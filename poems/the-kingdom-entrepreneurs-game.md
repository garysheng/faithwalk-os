# The Kingdom Game

***A poem for those called to build wealth righteously, abandoning scam economies for God's abundance***

We know that money can corrupt the soul,
And make even the kind hearted fall,
But believing poverty makes one pure and whole—
Is a lie that enslaves us all.

I saw big profits built on sin,
Empires that made the broken fall—
The wealthy feeding off within
The darkness that consumes us all.

My spirit craved a righteous path,
But seeing how riches often rise,
I wondered if The Most High's wrath
Would judge all wealth as compromise.

But then I heard the Truth ring clear:
Our God is God of abundance too.
He can bless those who hold Him dear
With riches pure and true.

I learned the rules of the Kingdom game:
First put God above your gold,
Give glory to His holy name,
Let Him guide what you build and hold.

Find the role only you can fill—
The calling made just for you:
Build His kingdom with your skill,
To make His vision true.

Create places that echo Heaven,
Where the poor are lifted high;
Break the chains of oppression,
Help them seek and multiply.

While the world's economies extract,
Drain the many to feed the few,
Kingdom wealth builds and multiplies back—
Blessing flows to all who pursue.

Satan presents some tempting trades:
'Compromise your faith for gold',
'Fund the systems that degrade
The innocent, young, and old';

I choose to play a different game
With fearless faith and love;
Steward wealth in Yeshua's name
To honor the power up above.

I trust in His vast supply—
He gives all talents, all we need
To win with Him, to lift souls high,
Defeat the dark, and plant His seed.
