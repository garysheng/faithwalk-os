# Appreciate Each Denomination’s Gifts

What should Christians learn from different denominations while avoiding denominational idolatry?

Study their strengths without believing any single denomination has exclusive salvation rights. It is my view that God did not provide one exclusive container for human salvation, and that many denominations offer valuable insights into following Christ.

Denominations can behave like apps competing for users. Some historically told people they'd face eternal damnation without joining that specific group—effective user acquisition, but questionable theology. When Christ was asked about the most important commandments, He said love God and love your neighbor, not "join the right denomination" (Matthew 22:37–40).

## What Denominations Do Well

I've spent the last couple years visiting different denominations' churches and getting to know some members from each, and here's what I love about a few of them:

**Orthodox Christianity:** Excellent preservation of ancient traditions and theological documentation. Deep understanding of how early church practices evolved and why they developed specific approaches to worship and doctrine.

**Catholic Scholarship:** Extensive theological libraries, systematic approaches to biblical interpretation, and intellectual rigor in addressing complex spiritual questions over centuries.

**Baptist Gospel Tradition:** Powerful music that authentically expresses love for God. The gospel sound and spiritual energy that flows from genuine worship and community celebration.

**Bible Churches:** Serious commitment to biblical study and teaching. Focus on understanding Scripture rather than just performing religious rituals.

**Pentecostal Spiritual Gifts:** Authentic expectation of miracles, healing, and Holy Spirit manifestation. Willingness to express faith through physical worship and emotional authenticity.

**Latter-day Saint Community Building:** Strong emphasis on family structures, community support, and global missionary commitment, even if theological differences exist.

## Denominational Corruption to Avoid

A persistent danger is that satanic influences can corrupt any denomination over time, even those that served God faithfully for centuries. Age and tradition don't guarantee theological purity.

Some denominations promote bad theology through corrupted biblical interpretation. The Scofield Reference Bible, for example, convinced millions that modern Israel represents biblical Israel, fueling geopolitical readings of prophecy that can confuse earthly politics with spiritual truth and have been used to justify genocidal wars. (If you think I'm wrong for making this characterization, let me know.)

Another danger related to the conversation on denominations lies in believers mistaking form for essence. As Jordan Hall observes: "We are almost always betrayed when we take the form for the essence. We are definitely always betrayed when the form takes itself as the essence and begins to perpetuate itself at the cost of the essence." ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC7tFJTEv6s&t=1724s&ab_channel=RossByrd))

This happens when denominations lose track that the form is not the thing and the form begins to attract power to itself and take itself as being the thing. It's a subtle process—you can convince yourself for years that you're serving Christ when you're actually mostly serving institutional forms (that may have deviated from the essence for power).

Hall illustrates this with a helpful analogy: "Think how absurd it would be if you were to say hey would you be interested in having a conversation with me and my first question was well what recording technology are we going to use... imagine if I was like well screw Riverside dude I only do Zoom calls I will not communicate with you on Riverside." That's exactly what happens when we make denominational forms ultimate rather than instrumental.

When asked "which church" can govern society properly, Hall responds: "I mean the church. I mean the Ecclesia... the Ecclesia is the ones that have been called out... The church is bigger than the form of the church into which it has been poured in a given context."

That seems right to me.

## My Approach to Denominational Learning

I visit different churches and read books by theologians from various traditions. Each offers perspectives on following Christ that I might not discover alone.

Rather than committing to one denomination's complete system, I study what each does well while maintaining my primary relationship with God through Scripture and prayer. Some people feel pressure to join a specific group for salvation—I believe God is bigger than any single organizational approach.

The goal isn't finding the "right" denomination but learning from mature Christians across traditions who demonstrate authentic love for God and neighbor (John 13:35).

## Recognition and Application

Ask these questions about any denominational teaching:

1. **Does this draw me closer to God or to the organization?**
2. **Does this emphasize loving God and neighbor above institutional loyalty?**
3. **Are the fruits of this teaching producing genuine holiness?**
4. **Does this require joining this group for salvation?**
5. **Does this bear the fruit of the Spirit? (Galatians 5:22–23)**

Study broadly, commit to Christ specifically. Learn from denominational strengths without making any denomination your idol.
