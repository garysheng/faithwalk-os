# The King Saul Pattern

When someone receives divine blessings and success, they often gradually start taking credit for what God gave them. Eventually they may care more about keeping their position than obeying God.

## Biblical Example: King Saul

King Saul was chosen by God, made king, given wealth and military victories. God commanded him to completely destroy the Amalekites and all their possessions *(1 Samuel 15:3)*, but Saul spared King Agag and the best livestock, rationalizing it as preserving them "to sacrifice to the Lord" *(1 Samuel 15:15)*. This selective obedience revealed his heart had shifted from stewardship to self-interest. When Samuel told him "Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you as king" *(1 Samuel 15:26)*, Saul's response exposed his priorities: **"I have sinned. But please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel"** *(1 Samuel 15:30)*. He clung to power and public status rather than accepting God's decision.

## Another Biblical Example: Nebuchadnezzar

King Nebuchadnezzar received divine dreams, conquered nations, and built magnificent Babylon—then declared "Is not this the great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty?" *(Daniel 4:30)*. God immediately humbled him to live like a beast until he acknowledged "the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth" *(Daniel 4:32)*. Nebuchadnezzar's restoration came through recognizing God's authority rather than clinging to his own.

## Modern Example: Jordan Peterson

**Phase 1 - Divine Calling:**
- Courageously opposed gender ideology 
- Provided profound biblical insights
- Gained massive following seeking truth
- Transformed from struggling professor to wealthy influencer

**Phase 2 - Corruption:**
- Selective silence on most important issues
- Financial capture compromised independence  
- Platform used to advance contradictory agendas
- Truth-seeking became truth-avoiding

Peterson didn't renounce his earlier truths—he simply went silent on consequential ones, becoming controlled opposition (appearing to oppose the system while actually serving it).

## How The Pattern Works

God gives someone genuine calling and success—both trials and blessings test the heart *(Proverbs 17:3, Jeremiah 17:10)*. Just as God tested Israel with wilderness provision "to know what was in your heart" *(Deuteronomy 8:2)*, prosperity reveals whether devotion is genuine or self-serving.

Too often, "God is using me" becomes "I am achieving this." When challenges threaten their position, they prioritize preserving blessing over divine alignment. Eventually they can't distinguish serving God from serving themselves, and may actively work against truths they once championed.

Blessings expose whether someone will demonstrate faithfulness, generosity, and continued reliance on God, or slip into pride and selfishness.

## How To Not Fall Victim To This Pattern

- Acknowledge everything belongs to God
- Regularly surrender your blessings back to Him
- Establish non-negotiable principles
- Surround yourself with people who prioritize your spiritual health over your success
- Periodically fast to maintain perspective

David succeeded where Saul failed by seeing position as service, crediting God for victories *(1 Samuel 17:47 - "the battle is the Lord's")*, quick repentance when confronted *(Psalm 51 after Nathan's rebuke)*, seeking guidance *(1 Samuel 23:2 - repeatedly asking God before battle)*, and staying teachable despite success *(2 Samuel 12:13 - "I have sinned against the Lord").*

The pattern is avoidable, but requires constant vigilance and humility. Choose David's path of dependence over Saul's path of pride.
