# The Salvation Prayer

---

***Good for people devoting their lives to Christ. Also good for rededicating oneself to Christ.***

This format of prayer is biblical. Romans 10:9-10 says: "If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."

You can receive Him today. It's not hard. All of God's blessings and the benefits of salvation can be yours if you receive Him into your heart.

Father, I believe.  
And I receive these words in Jesus' name.

And I say this, Father:  
I believe in Jesus.  
I believe Jesus died for my sins.  
I believe you raised Jesus from the dead.  
Jesus is alive and well.

Thank you, Jesus, for saving me.  
I receive my salvation.

I'm asking you to come into my heart,  
be my Lord and Savior.

I confess:  
I have sinned,  
I have missed it.

I'm asking you to forgive me  
and cleanse me from all unrighteousness.

Thank you, Jesus.  
You never say no to your word.

I am born again.  
I am in right standing with you.  
My sins are thrown into the sea of forgetfulness.  
I am right with you again.

Thank you, Lord Jesus.

Now, set me aflame with your fire.  
Heal my body.
Restore my body.

Thank you, Father.  
I receive it all right now.

Thank you for not giving up on me.  
Thank you for never turning your back on me.  
Thank you for loving me.

I love you, Lord.

In Jesus' name.  

**Amen.**
