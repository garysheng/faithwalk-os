# Why America Feels Like Hell

### ***When you wake up as an awakened follower of Christ, and you start to love what Christ loves, and hate what Christ hates, you realize that the United States has become the 'world' incarnate—a living monument of rebellion against God***

I used to think America was basically good. Flawed but redeemable. A Christian nation that had lost its way but could find it again with the right leaders and policies.

I was wrong.

**America does not serve God. America serves mammon.**

*"No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon." — Matthew 6:24*

(In the Bible, mammon is often used to represent material wealth, riches, or possessions, and sometimes even the worldly values associated with them.)

We've built a civilization that worships money.

One that also worships earthly power, and what Americans call "freedom"—which really means the freedom to be degenerate, to cause societal decay, to destroy the sources of truth and life.

The more freedom we Americans get, the more we seem to use that freedom to rebel against Christ.

Notice how no one asks for more rights to be constrained. No one asks for more freedom to walk the narrow path. Our worship of freedom has brought us straight to hell.

I am astonished how upside down this country has become. As Paul warned: "They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator" (Romans 1:25).

When you embrace what Christ actually wants—turning away from the world—you see America clearly. We are not in God's favor. We're a country where billions of Bibles have been printed throughout our history, yet we've chosen systematic disobedience anyway.

## **The Syndicate of Satan Controls America**

Satan must be proud of his successful military coup of America. The devil has his grips in America precisely because Americans have so much potential to be saved and help save others—Satan always attacks what threatens him most.

What does it look like to live in a nation captured by Satan?

It's almost impossible to live and participate in American society without constantly sinning, or constantly suffering. The infrastructure of American life is designed to make you fall, or barely survive. *[See: Recognize and Resist Sinfrastructure](../principles/recognize-and-resist-sinfrastructure.md) for understanding how these systems are engineered to promote sin.*

Our phones activate lust on demand. Our apps turn us into gambling addicts. Our entertainment celebrates what God calls abomination. Our leaders fund wars while trafficking children.

This isn't accidental.

Satan and his minions have designed systems that profit from human weakness while ordinary Americans struggle to survive—much less live virtuously—within infrastructure engineered for their moral failure.

They have made virtue requires superhuman effort while vice flows downhill: Following Christ means swimming against every current of normal life; and speaking truth costs you access, income, and relationships.

## **The Presidents Tell the Story**

Look at our presidents. They represent what we actually value, not what we claim to value.

We elect liars and child predators who start abominable wars to enrich arms dealers and their investors. We celebrate them as they take God's name in vain while advancing anti-Christian policies around the world.

Who we elect as leaders is a reflection of generations of spiritual warfare that might just be a preview of the end times. A nation that repeatedly chooses leaders who mock God (while claiming divine blessing) is a nation that deserves harsh judgment.

The supposed fight between libertarianism and socialists/communists is largely different flavors of secular materialism—false lights distracting us from the real issue. *[See: Don't Advance Anti-Christian Causes](../principles/dont-advance-anti-christian-causes.md) for discerning these competing ideologies that ultimately lead away from Christ.* While some principles like liberty under law have allowed Christianity to flourish here more than in oppressive regimes, all this culture war noise is just rearranging chairs on the Titanic while people avoid acknowledging that Christ's Way is extremely narrow and extremely difficult to follow.

A democratic socialist is no worse than an unrepentant, corrupt, money-loving "Christian" leader. Libertarianism has no soul and no answer to the moral questions that actually matter. Socialism and communism are hyper-materialistic, obsessed with money and power like everything else.

These secular ideologies presented as our only options aren't even on the table for Christians who want to stay focused on what they should actually be doing in the world.

The deeper issue is that we've made idols out of everything except Christ. *[See: Reserve the Pedestal for God](../principles/reserve-the-pedestal-for-god.md) for understanding how modern culture systematically creates false worship.*

## **American Elites' Lust For Money & Power Is Insatiable**

American elites have an insatiable lust for materialism, status, and power. They set the standard for what is celebrated in our culture: wealth, influence, and the ability to bend the rules for personal gain. Even within American Christianity, the faith of the powerful is often measured by their material success—more money is seen as a sign of greater blessing. We idolize celebrities and moguls who are spiritually bankrupt, and entire industries profit from exploitation and vice, often hidden behind the veneer of entertainment.

The Epstein network’s exposure revealed just how deeply depravity is embedded among the highest levels of American power. For the elite, even the most heinous crimes are shielded by money and connections.

In America, the legal and political systems are engineered to protect the wealthy and powerful, while the poor are left defenseless. Justice is routinely auctioned off to those who can afford it.

Our schools, under the influence of these same elites, have become factories for producing compliant workers rather than thinkers or builders. Critical thought and discernment are casualties of an education system designed to serve the interests of those at the top.

The biopharma industry, led by elite investors and executives, is already positioning itself to profit from the spiritual and existential crisis gripping the nation. Instead of addressing the root causes of emptiness, they offer chemical solutions that numb rather than heal.

Private equity firms—another tool of the elite—have transformed basic human needs into opportunities for relentless profit extraction. Homeownership is out of reach for millions as these firms buy up housing, degrade quality, and rent it back at inflated prices. They monopolize industries, cut corners, and turn once-reliable products into disposable junk, all to maximize returns for a small class of investors.

The cruelty of elite power goes beyond economics. I know someone who was targeted by a private equity firm and, through a secretive legal process, was forced to make unimaginable sacrifices—including being compelled to abort her child as part of a settlement. This is the logical endpoint of a system where Mammon reigns: life itself is expendable if it stands in the way of profit.

We have elevated the wrong people—tech oligarchs and financial titans who have amassed unprecedented control and are constructing a surveillance state beyond anything previously imagined. Companies like Palantir, backed by Silicon Valley and Wall Street, are building the digital infrastructure for mass monitoring, all while presenting themselves as champions of freedom and democracy. Their appetite for control is matched only by their hunger for wealth and power.

## **There Are No Quick Fixes**

I'm not writing this to offer solutions because there aren't any quick fixes for this level of societal degeneration. We're looking at a multi-decade dark age, if not complete collapse.

When a country this blessed chooses systematic rebellion against God, the consequences are civilizational. You can't policy your way out of spiritual death. You can't vote your way back to righteousness when the entire system profits from sin.

That said, I have written about how Christians can create strongholds within a fallen country in my piece on building [Christofuturist towns](https://substack.garysheng.com/p/refounding). But even then, it is multi-decade long project to create a new center of gravity for obedient Christians.

Some ask: "Is it time to leave America? Where do you escape to?"

The hard truth is that Satan's influence is pervasive across the earth. Other countries have their own spiritual darkness.

There is no physical escape. Wherever you go, there you are. You either walk in truth—Jesus Christ as truth incarnate—or you keep falling into sin and despair no matter what passport you hold.

I'm in the middle of killing my old self right now, and it's brutally difficult. It means leaving behind almost all of your friends. Saying no to almost every invite and job opportunity because they're not the calling God has for you.

The narrow path is narrow as can be.

## **What This Means for American Christians**

Take America off your pedestal. Stop trying to make it great when it has repeatedly chosen rebellion over righteousness.

Yes, America has had moments of grace—the abolition movement, Great Awakenings that birthed hospitals and schools, billions of Bibles spreading the Gospel worldwide. But just ask the descendants of African slaves about the systematic destruction of their families after emancipation. God has used flawed nations before, but that doesn't excuse our ongoing disobedience.

Stop confusing patriotism with Christianity.

**Put Christ first and foremost.** Put all your attention toward Him if you've turned away or deprioritized Him.

**Disentangle from corrupting systems.** *[See: Sever Your Ties With Modern Culture](../principles/sever-your-ties-with-modern-culture.md) for practical steps to separate from the cultural systems that make sin feel natural and righteousness feel heroic.*

(This is advice to myself as much as anyone!)

**Accept the generational reality.** There will be huge swaths of millennials and Gen Z—and probably Gen Alpha as well—who will simply not be able to afford to have a family, to have a single child. There's not much we can do about this immediate reality. We are the living embodiment of facing the consequences of a country that for generations has chosen Mammon over Truth. We are the victims of it.

Despite the harsh reality of our situation, I do believe it matters to still try to plant seeds for future generations, even if we will be old by the time we see the fruits pay off.

I don't know if it is America's destiny to be redeemed. That's a project that would require mass repentance. But our God is the God of miracles...

Pray for America's leaders and lost souls—God desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:1-4).

The good thing is that your job isn't to save America. Your job is to follow Christ and be salt and light (Matthew 5:13-16)—even if, especially if, your country has chosen hell.
