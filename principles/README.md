# Principles

These documents capture my practical frameworks for walking the narrow path. Each principle is designed to be legible, critiquable, and forkable.

## How to Use
- Start with identity and posture, then move to environment and practice
- Follow cross-links; many principles reinforce each other
- Apply the Recognition and Practice questions at the end of each file

## Contributing / Forking
- One principle per file; use kebab-case filenames
- Include: brief thesis, core argument, Scripture anchors, Recognition and Practice
- Add cross-links to related principles and to the Executive Summary: ../christian-ontology_executive-summary.md
