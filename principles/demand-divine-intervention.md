# Demand Divine Intervention

*You are not a beggar pleading for mercy—you are an heir demanding justice. God owes you recompense for every injustice, every theft, every moment of suffering that hell has inflicted upon your life.*

Stop accepting sickness, poverty, and oppression as "God's will." Start demanding divine intervention as your covenant right. The same God who brought Israel out of Egypt "with silver and gold, and there was not one feeble person among their tribes" wants to compensate you for everything the devil has stolen.

This isn't about greed—it's about justice. This isn't about entitlement—it's about inheritance. When you understand recompense theology, you stop begging and start claiming what rightfully belongs to you as a child of the King.

*[See: Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.](../profiles/delmar-coward-jr.md) for understanding this theology through a modern apostle who demonstrates supernatural results.*

## The Legal Framework of Recompense

**Recompense** is God's divine justice system—His promise to compensate believers for everything that has been unjustly taken from them by the devil, circumstances, or systemic oppression.

> "Recompense means everybody say pay day. That's what it means... to compensate, to repay, to make imminent. It means pay day... to finish, to make safe, to make whole are good, to restore, to reckon, to make good, to pay, to require, to recompense, to reward." — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

### Biblical Foundation
- **Hebrews 10:30**: "Vengeance belongeth to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord"
- **Proverbs 11:31**: "Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth"
- **Isaiah 43:25**: "Even I am he that blotted out thy transgressions for my own sake"

**Critical Point**: Recompense happens on EARTH, not just in heaven. This is immediate, tangible, material compensation for injustice suffered.

## God as Judge, Not Emotional Avenger

> "That's not revenge. That's not a... An emotional thing that God is going to do. It's not an emotional thing at all. It's got everything vengeance and recompense. It's got to do with justice. Our God is a God of justice." — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

Understanding this distinction changes everything:
- **Traditional Christianity**: "God, please help me" (begging for mercy)
- **Recompense Theology**: "God, I demand justice" (claiming legal rights)

You qualify for recompense not because you're perfect, but because you're righteous through faith in Christ. It's not based on works—it's based on your legal standing as God's child.

## Categories of Divine Intervention You Can Demand

### 1. Health and Healing
Sickness is injustice because believers are "redeemed from the curse." You've been sick too long—sickness violates your covenant rights.

**Declaration**: "I demand healing as compensation for unjust suffering. Devil, you will pay damages for every day you've stolen through illness."

### 2. Financial Breakthrough
God owes you wealth to compensate for poverty, lack, and financial oppression. This includes:
- **Ancestral Land Rights**: Property that was stolen from previous generations
- **Sevenfold Return**: Based on biblical restitution principles  
- **Supernatural Provision**: Angels as reapers bringing in your harvest

**Declaration**: "I claim ancestral wealth. I declare sevenfold return on what was stolen. I expect supernatural provision as divine justice."

### 3. Generational Restoration
What was stolen from previous generations is still owed to descendants. You can claim restoration of:
- Family relationships destroyed by trauma
- Opportunities lost through systemic oppression
- Blessings interrupted by generational curses

**Declaration**: "I break generational curses. I claim restoration of what was stolen from my bloodline. I declare protection over my children's inheritance."

### 4. Supernatural Longevity
Based on biblical mathematics (Genesis 6:3 + Proverbs 3:2), believers can claim a 145-year lifespan through faith declarations. This isn't wishful thinking—it's covenant promise.

**Declaration**: "I declare 145 years of life. My days are long and prosperous. Death has no dominion over me before my appointed time."

## Activation Mechanisms for Divine Intervention

### 1. Faith as Transportation System
> "Faith trumps time... It reaches places we can't go" — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

Faith is always "NOW"—not future-oriented. It's a transportation system that brings heavenly realities (like healing) into the present moment, superseding time and space. You must:
- **Know** God's promises
- **Believe** them absolutely  
- **Speak** them with authority
- **Receive** them immediately

**Declaration**: "It's my time now. Faith is transporting my breakthrough from heaven to earth right now."

### 2. The Two Systems Theology
Understanding which system you're operating in determines your results:

**The Devil's System**: Designed to keep you down, accepting circumstances as permanent
**God's Kingdom System**: A "no-lose system" that lifts you up through faith

You are a **thermostat** who changes environments through faith, not a **thermometer** that accepts circumstances. Choose which system you'll operate in daily.

### 3. Make the Devil Pay Damages
> "Make the devil pay the damages. You've been sick too long. You've been broke too long... I declare recompense... make the devil pay the damages devil." — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

This isn't passive prayer—it's aggressive spiritual warfare. You're not asking God to maybe help you. You're demanding that the devil compensate you for theft.

### 4. The Declaration + Worship Formula
Based on the 10 lepers—one returned to worship and was made "whole" (not just healed):
> "I declare it, I receive it, I worship you Lord"

**The Process**:
1. **Declare** your legal right to recompense
2. **Receive** it by faith before you see it
3. **Worship** God for His justice system

### 5. Faith Visualization and Creative Power
> "See yourself with what you want... You can have what you see" — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

Tap into "the mind of Christ" as creative power:
- **Visualize wholeness** before it manifests physically
- **Imagine the end result** (both hands raised for stroke victims, perfect health, abundant provision)
- **Speak to your situation** as if it's already changed
- **Ignore medical reports** that contradict God's promises

### 6. Spoken Commands and Direct Confrontation
Address sickness and demons directly:
- **Command sickness to leave**: "Arthritis, you bow down in Jesus' name"
- **Declare body parts brand new**: "I declare these kidneys brand new, these bones brand new"
- **Bind spirits of infirmity**: "Spirit of cancer, I bind you and command you to go"
- **Speak life over death**: "You don't have cancer anymore, so don't say it"

### 7. Using Kingdom Authority
> "He took everything back, the keys of life, the keys of death and every key that you need for your life. And then it gave it to you... I give you the keys of the kingdom. Everybody say, I got the keys." — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

You have legal authority in the spiritual realm. Use it with:
- **Anointing oil** applied with prayers binding sickness
- **Laying on of hands** to transfer anointing (angels assist in this process)
- **Remote healing** through faith declarations (distance is no barrier)
- **Territorial claims** like "This is a cancer-free sanctuary"

## Historical Patterns of Divine Intervention

### Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
- **Injustice**: Thrown into fiery furnace unjustly
- **Recompense**: Promoted, protected, and the king decreed death for anyone speaking against their God

### Daniel in the Lion's Den
- **Injustice**: Thrown to lions for praying
- **Recompense**: Lions couldn't harm him, his accusers were devoured, he was promoted

### Children of Israel in Egypt
- **Injustice**: 400 years of slavery
- **Recompense**: "He brought them out with the silver and the gold, and that was not one feeble person among their tribe. That's called recompense."

**Pattern**: The longer the delay, the greater the recompense. Even generational injustice eventually gets divine compensation—with interest.

## My Experience With Demanding Divine Intervention

I'm still learning to operate in this level of faith, but I've begun to see results when I stop begging and start claiming.

Instead of praying "God, please heal my anxiety," I now declare: "Devil, you have no legal right to torment my mind. I demand compensation for every sleepless night, every panic attack, every moment of peace you've stolen. I claim divine restoration with interest."

Instead of "God, please provide financially," I declare: "I am a child of the King. Poverty is beneath my inheritance. I claim the wealth of the wicked stored up for the righteous. Angels, go and bring in my harvest."

The shift from supplication to declaration changes your spiritual posture entirely. You stop operating from weakness and start operating from authority.

## Obstacles to Divine Intervention

### 1. Religious Limitation
> "No more religion. No more religion. That's weak. It's time to have what God said." — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

Traditional Christianity has taught us to accept suffering as "God's mysterious will." Recompense theology demands we reject this passivity.

### 2. Unbelief vs. Disbelief
- **Unbelief**: Haven't been taught, so can't believe yet
- **Disbelief**: Heard the truth but choose not to believe (operates in "devilish satanic powers")

### 3. Accepting Injustice as Normal
**Wrong Thinking**: "God gave me this sickness to teach me something"
**Correct Thinking**: "God wants me healed and will compensate me for this injustice"

### 4. Negative Word Agreements
> "The power of life and death is not in the virus. It's in my mouth" — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

Your words either build hedges of protection or remove them (like Job's story). Common blocks include:
- **Unforgiveness** toward those who hurt you
- **Fear-based speaking** ("What if I don't get healed?")
- **Symptom reporting** instead of faith declarations
- **Agreement with medical limitations** over God's promises

**Solution**: Guard your words, speak only victory, and demand sevenfold restoration from the devil for stolen health.

## Practical Applications for Daily Life

### Morning Declarations
Start each day claiming your rights:
- "I am Kingdom. I know the word. I believe the word. I speak the word and I receive the word."
- "Devil, today you will pay damages for every attack against my family."
- "Angels, bring in my harvest. Wealth flows to me from unexpected sources."
- "I choose God's kingdom system today—I am a thermostat, not a thermometer."
- "Faith is transporting my breakthrough from heaven to earth RIGHT NOW."
- "Everything I need for healing was finished before the world's foundation."

### Audit Your Life
Ask yourself: What has been stolen from you?
- Health stolen through sickness
- Wealth stolen through exploitation  
- Peace stolen through trauma
- Time stolen through oppression
- Relationships destroyed by evil

Then demand compensation for each area.

### Prepare for Increase
Don't just demand intervention—prepare to steward what's coming. Get ready to manage the wealth, health, and influence God will restore to you.

## The Prophetic Dimension

We're entering a season where God's justice system is accelerating. What took generations to resolve will happen in months. What seemed impossible will become inevitable.

> "God told me that something crazy was going to happen, some diseases, some things are going to happen. And if you put that mantle above your doorpost, then no devil will be able to come in." — Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

Divine protection and divine intervention are both increasing as we approach the end times. Those who understand recompense theology will thrive while others struggle.

## Reflection and Practice

**Ask yourself as you begin demanding divine intervention:**

1. **Am I operating as a beggar or as an heir?**
2. **What injustices in my life require divine compensation?**
3. **Do I believe God owes me justice, or am I just hoping for mercy?**
4. **Am I prepared to steward the restoration that's coming?**

Stop accepting less than God's best for your life. Stop spiritualizing away material needs. Stop calling poverty "humility" and sickness "God's will."

You are a child of the King. Demand divine intervention. Make the devil pay damages. Claim your inheritance with interest.

The same God who delivered Israel with silver and gold wants to compensate you for every injustice you've suffered. It's not greed—it's justice. It's not presumption—it's faith.

**Declare it. Receive it. Worship Him for it.**
