# Make God Your Best Friend

*When was the last day you spent more time talking with God than scrolling social media?*

Most of us treat God like a distant acquaintance we check in with occasionally—Sunday mornings, crisis moments, maybe a quick prayer before meals. But what if we approached Him like our closest friend? Someone we speak and listen to constantly, share everything with, and turn to for guidance on every decision?

The difference between knowing about God and knowing God personally comes down to communion. Constant, ongoing conversation. Prayer that becomes as natural as breathing rather than a religious obligation we check off our list.

Your relationship with God can be the most intimate, honest, and transformative friendship of your life. But like any friendship, it requires time, attention, and genuine communication.

Christ told His disciples, "I have called you friends" (John 15:15). Friendship with God isn't a metaphor—it's His own description of the relationship He offers.

## The Practice of Constant Communion

Prayer isn't meant to be confined to designated times and places. It's meant to be the background music of your life—an ongoing dialogue with your Creator about everything you're experiencing.

The Oxford Group, a Christian movement from the 1930s, understood this. They taught that anyone can be in touch with God anywhere, anytime, if certain conditions are met: be quiet and still, listen, be honest about every thought, and test what comes against Scripture and spiritual fruit.

They emphasized writing down everything that comes to mind during prayer—not editing or judging, just capturing. Because writing by hand without filtering can help bypass mental filters and capture impressions you might otherwise miss. Some sessions produce nothing useful; others deliver guidance so specific it's striking.

My friend Peter Han embodies this approach. He maintains a small council of trusted friends for major life decisions—not because he can't hear God alone, but because "we collectively have the mind of Christ" (see 1 Corinthians 2:16), and spiritual discernment benefits from multiple perspectives. They pray together regularly, even when not co-located, seeking God's will rather than just His blessing on their preferred outcomes.

## The Obstacles to Intimacy

The biggest barrier to deeper friendship with God isn't theological—it's habitual.

For me, it's constantly checking social media, especially X. I'll reach for my phone dozens of times daily, seeking the dopamine hit of new information, controversy, or validation. Meanwhile, I might spend 10 minutes in focused prayer and consider myself spiritually disciplined. *[See: Sever Your Ties With Modern Culture](sever-your-ties-with-modern-culture.md) for breaking free from these digital addictions.*

The math is embarrassing. I probably spend 10x more time consuming other people's thoughts than listening for God's voice. I've trained my brain to crave digital stimulation over divine communion.

Bad default habits don't just steal time—they rewire our attention spans. After hours of scrolling, sitting quietly to listen for God's still small voice feels almost impossible. Our minds race, seeking the next notification, the next hit of artificial engagement.

Large, 10-20 person Bible studies can be helpful, but I've found the most growth in small groups of 3–4 where we go deep on real issues with people who actually know each other's struggles.

## My Experience Building Divine Friendship

One of my favorite ways to pray recently has been having soulful conversations about God with close friends. Not as a substitute for one to one communion with God, but as a complement to it.

When I talk through spiritual questions with friends who love God and have my back, it becomes a form of prayer itself. We're seeking God's heart together, testing insights against Scripture, and encouraging each other toward deeper faith. These conversations often reveal God's character and will more clearly than solo prayer sessions.

I've also learned that prayer works best when it's honest rather than polished. God already knows what you're thinking and feeling. The pretense of formal religious language can actually create distance rather than intimacy.

The Oxford Group taught that God cares about everything—names of people to contact, things to do, things to say, things that need to be made right. No concern is too small, no decision too mundane for divine input.

I'm learning to pray about work decisions, relationship tensions, even what to eat for dinner. Not because God is a cosmic butler, but because He cares about every aspect of my life and wants to be involved in all of it.

## Building the Friendship

**Replace digital defaults with divine dialogue.** Every time you reach for your phone out of boredom or anxiety, pause and talk to God instead. Even 30 seconds of "God, what do you want me to know right now?" beats scrolling.

**Write without editing.** Keep a physical notebook for prayer. Write down everything that comes to mind—thoughts, impressions, random ideas. Test it later against Scripture, wise counsel, and spiritual fruit, but capture it first.

**Find your prayer council.** Like Peter Han, identify 2-3 believers who can pray with you about major decisions. Collective discernment often reveals what individual prayer misses.

**Fast from distractions.** Set aside dedicated times (e.g., one day a week or an hour daily) to unplug from devices and focus solely on listening to God—build your prayer muscle like any other discipline.

**Talk to God about everything.** Share your fears, frustrations, excitement, confusion. Ask for guidance on decisions both big and small. Treat Him like the friend who knows everything about you and loves you anyway.

## Reflection and Practice

**Ask yourself as you evaluate your relationship with God:**

1. **Do I talk to God more than I scroll social media?**
2. **Am I seeking God's will or just His blessing on my plans?**
3. **Do I trust God enough to be completely honest with Him?**
4. **Would my closest friends say I'm more influenced by God's voice or cultural voices?**

The goal isn't perfect prayer habits—it's genuine friendship. God wants your authentic self, not your religious performance. He's already pursuing relationship with you. The question is whether you'll make space for the friendship He's offering.

*"Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you." — James 4:8*

Prayer: Jesus, teach me to live in constant communion. Quiet my mind, tune my ears to Your voice, and form in me a heart that prefers Your presence over every lesser thing. Amen.
