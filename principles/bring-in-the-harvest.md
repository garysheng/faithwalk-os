# Bring In The Harvest

*"The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest field." — Matthew 9:37-38*

God isn't waiting on better circumstances, more resources, or perfect timing to return. He's waiting on us to bring in the harvest. The fields are white and ready—souls all around us are hungry for truth, meaning, and authentic relationship with their Creator (John 4:35).

You don't need seminary training, a platform, or special calling to be a laborer in God's harvest. You just need to be who you are in Christ—authentically, consistently, and with genuine love for the people He puts in your path.

The harvest happens through ordinary believers living extraordinary lives that point others toward Christ. Not through performance, but through presence. Not through preaching, but through being the light.

## The Urgency of the Hour

We're living in times Jesus warned about—moral confusion, technological overreach, spiritual deception on every side. This is precisely when the church should be most active in harvest work.

The fields have never been more ready. People are exhausted by empty promises from politics, technology, and self-help movements. They're discovering that success without God leaves them hollow. Material prosperity can't fill the God-shaped hole in their hearts.

It would not reveal God's power if He returned while we left the fields untouched; the harvest is abundant and the laborers are few.

God would rather delay His return to gather more souls than leave behind those He died to save. Every person matters that much to Him. He would have died for just one of us—how much more does He want to rescue the millions still searching?

God intentionally concealed the timing of Christ's return so we would live with daily harvest urgency. If we knew He was coming in 100 years, we might become complacent. If we knew He was coming tomorrow, we might panic. Not knowing keeps us faithfully working the fields every single day, always ready, always reaching the lost around us.

## The Power of Authentic Presence

You don't bring in harvest by forcing conversations about faith or cornering people with gospel presentations. You bring it in by being so authentically transformed by Christ that people want what you have. (1 Corinthians 3:6-9: "I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth... For we are God's fellow workers.")

You don't have to go behind a camera or go on a platform and preach a big sermon. Just be who you are when you go into a grocery store or a sports game. Be who you are when you go to work every day. Embody Him, let Him shine through you and be a light to others. Your life will draw them in—your being becomes the net that brings them in.

People are watching how you handle stress, loss, success, and ordinary moments. They notice if you have peace they don't have, joy that circumstances can't steal, and love that extends beyond your inner circle.

The anointing isn't for personal enjoyment—it's a tool for service. Like a hammer to a carpenter or a tractor to a farmer, God's presence in your life is meant to attract others to Him, not just make you feel good.

## My Experience in Harvest Work

Over the past couple of years since I've been more open about my faith, I've had dozens of people reach out wanting to understand my perspective. Not because I've been pushy or preachy, but because authenticity is magnetic.

My "ministry"—if you want to call it that—happens through ordinary availability. Book recommendations when someone asks what I'm reading. Phone calls when friends are processing spiritual questions. Text conversations when people share their experiences with God or their challenges with faith.

The most fruitful moments often come during life's difficult seasons—when friends are getting divorced, losing partners, getting laid off, experiencing family tragedies, or entering overwhelming periods. People become most open to God when their own resources run out.

I've also found that material success creates spiritual curiosity. People who achieve what they thought they wanted often realize something crucial is still missing. They want to know how to handle success well, how to find meaning beyond accumulation.

The key is meeting people where they are with genuine care, not agenda. Help them authentically as you would want to be helped. As they express curiosity, invite them deeper into relationship with God—not through pressure, but through patient love.

## Discerning the True Harvest

Not everyone who wears a cross or professes Christianity is walking with Christ. Even among those who call themselves believers, discern by the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22–23) evident in their lives, rather than by religious language alone.

This discernment is not about harsh judgment but grace-filled wisdom—loving all while investing more deeply in those showing the Spirit's transforming work. *[See: Don’t Be A Churchian](dont-be-a-churchian.md).*

This matters for harvest work because your time and energy are limited. While we're called to love everyone, wisdom guides us to pour into those with genuine hunger for God, trusting the Spirit to work in all hearts.

Look for signs of the Spirit's work such as humility, repentance, love for God's word, concern for the lost, and willingness to be corrected. Some may resist conviction, prefer comfort over truth, and show little evidence of the Holy Spirit's transforming work in their lives.

## Being Available for the Harvest

**Show up in difficult moments.** When people face crisis, loss, or overwhelming circumstances, they become most receptive to spiritual truth. Be present with practical help and genuine care.

**Let your life invite their questions.** Live with such peace, joy, and purpose that people wonder what's different about you. Let your character create curiosity about your faith.

**Share resources generously.** When people express spiritual interest, have books, podcasts, or connections ready. Be a bridge to deeper truth, not a bottleneck. Feel free to share my 'Faith Walk OS' with them, or create your own to share!

**Discern spiritual hunger.** Test the fruits of those who claim faith. Invest more time with those showing genuine transformation rather than just religious language.

**Pray for divine appointments.** Ask God to put people in your path who are ready for harvest. Expect Him to orchestrate conversations and connections.

**Remember it's God's work.** You're not responsible for converting anyone—you're responsible for being faithful to love, serve, and point toward Jesus. The Holy Spirit does the heart work.

**Share your testimony naturally.** When conversations turn to life challenges or meaning, briefly share how Christ has transformed your journey—without forcing it.

**Practice hospitality.** Open your home for meals and fellowship; create spaces where spiritual conversations flow organically.

## Reflection and Practice

**Ask yourself as you consider your role in the harvest:**

1. **Am I living in a way that makes people curious about my faith?**
2. **Do I see interruptions and difficult conversations as harvest opportunities?**
3. **Am I available when God puts seeking people in my path?**
4. **Would people say I reflect Christ's love in practical, everyday moments?**

The harvest is indeed plentiful. Souls all around you are hungry for what only Jesus can provide. Your job isn't to be perfect—it's to be authentic, available, and filled with His love.

Be the light. Let your life draw them in. The fields are white and ready for harvest.

*"Let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven." — Matthew 5:16*
