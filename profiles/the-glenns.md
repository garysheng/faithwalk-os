# Devon & Mie Glenn

**Location:** Okinawa, Japan  
**Ministry:** Heaven's Burger (Marketplace Ministry)  
**Focus:** Evangelism, Healing, Discipleship in Japan

## What Motivated Their Devotion to Christ

Devon came from a successful rock band that sold millions of records, while Mie grew up in traditional Japanese Buddhism and Shintoism. Despite worldly success - including a million-dollar business - they felt a profound void. A chance encounter at a gym led Devon to church, where both experienced God's love through worship music and community. The turning point came during a mission trip to Africa, where they witnessed supernatural manifestations of God's presence and felt called to surrender everything.

"We had a house and a business and everything... So we decided, okay, we got to let this go, surrender everything to God and just follow Jesus whatever he asked us to do."

## How They're Thriving While Keeping God First

**Complete Surrender:** They sold their million-dollar business, house, and possessions to follow God's call to Japan - a country where Mie had sworn never to return.

**Marketplace Ministry:** Started Heaven's Cafe in rural Niigata, then transitioned to Heaven's Burger food truck in Okinawa. They cook with intentional prayer, believing God works through them to heal, unite families, and break strongholds through their food.

**Supernatural Ministry:** Witnessed salvations, baptisms, healings, and deliverance in Japan where most have never heard of Jesus. "It's like the book of Acts out here. It really is."

**Community Building:** Host monthly music events combining Devon's professional music background with worship, creating natural evangelism opportunities for Japanese and foreign communities.

**Walking by Faith:** When Devon became critically ill, God directed them to Okinawa for healing. A stranger's prophetic dream about Jesus driving a food truck to them confirmed their path forward.

**Kingdom Mindset:** Supported by Yomitan International Church, they model surrendered living where striving is replaced by Spirit-led obedience, resulting in provision and fruitfulness.
