# Gary's Christian Ontology: A Brief Overview

### *The Most High God created everything and operates reality through spiritual laws that produce practical outcomes, before and after death, when followed faithfully.*

## The Foundation

The Most High God (TMH) exists as Father, Son (Yeshua/Jesus), and Holy Spirit—three persons, one God. He created everything and keeps promises to those who follow Him. The main promise is if you follow His spiritual laws, you will experience a flourishing spirit life before death, and eternal life reunited fully with TMH after death.

We are tripartite beings: spirit (our connection to TMH), soul (mind, will, emotions), and body (physical form). After death, if saved, your spirit and soul reunite with TMH. Before death, we are called to be saved by grace through faith for works, evidenced by turning from sin.

We should trust TMH because his description of reality via the Bible is spiritually accurate. When you follow TMH's design for character, relationships, and purpose, holy doors open, relationships deepen, peace replaces anxiety, and clarity emerges. When you violate these principles, everything becomes harder and eventually breaks down.

Christ as the Logos—the divine Word and rational principle—makes reality intelligible and actionable in ways that secular frameworks cannot. For centuries, Greek philosophers like Heraclitus and the Stoics searched for this hidden harmony that orders all existence, while Eastern traditions like Taoism intuited an ultimate Way. Christ reveals Himself as the answer they were seeking: the personal Logos who became flesh.

He provides the grounding upon which existence makes sense, serving as the ultimate decision-making framework that transforms chaos into coherence. In our age of moral relativism where "your truth" and "my truth" fragment society, Christ as Logos offers objective truth that transcends human opinion while remaining personally accessible. Every thing has its logos (purpose and design), and sin is the disconnection of things from their true logoi. When we align with Christ, we discover the true purpose of all things, and reality transforms from dead material into vibrant, meaningful existence.

## Salvation and Spiritual Transformation

Salvation comes by grace (TMH loving you), through faith (you loving TMH back), for works (loving, embodying, and doing what TMH loves), evidenced by turning from sin (hating and resisting what TMH hates). The Holy Spirit convicts of sin, guides into truth, and enables transformation.

Yeshua is both savior and Lord—He died for our sins, rose from the dead, and provides the only path to salvation. He currently intercedes for believers and will return as judge and king. The greatest commandments are loving God completely and loving your neighbor as yourself.

Most people who call themselves Christians but don't live like they fear TMH are lukewarm Christians or what I call 'Churchians'. Don't model yourself after them. Also, many "Christian" leaders are actually agents of Satan operating within church networks and seats of power. *[See: Don’t Be A Churchian](principles/dont-be-a-churchian.md).* 

## Spiritual Warfare Is Real

Satan is a fallen angel commanding evil spirits to corrupt people into sin. He operates everywhere—churches, homes, high offices—as the "god" of this world. We're living through spiritual warfare, but most don't recognize it because Satan's strategy is subtle: making people spiritually depressed and confused while convincing them it's personal failure.

The enemy operates through "sinfrastructure"—systems designed to make sin feel natural and righteousness feel heroic. Social media fragments worldviews. Dating apps commodify relationships. Impact organizations divert energy from God's calling into impotent secular metrics. *[See detailed analysis: Recognize and Resist Sinfrastructure](principles/recognize-and-resist-sinfrastructure.md)*

Evil rarely asks for your soul upfront. It asks for your silence, your compromise, your comfort with injustice. Most people drift into complicity rather than choosing it outright.

Christians are not called to be passive in the face of evil—we're called to actively resist and make Satan's work as difficult as possible. *[See: Make Satan Struggle](principles/make-satan-struggle.md) for understanding how to courageously confront corruption rather than accepting comfortable compromise.*

For practical steps to disentangle from cultural systems—and from relationships and rhythms that keep you compromised—*[see: Sever Your Ties With Modern Culture](principles/sever-your-ties-with-modern-culture.md).* 

## The Two Masters Problem

Matthew 6:24 reveals the core issue: "No one can serve two masters." You cannot worship money while wanting TMH's favor. You cannot serve TMH while optimizing for worldly approval. These competing loyalties create internal contradiction that destroys spiritual clarity and practical effectiveness.

There are two ways to make a living: the atheistic way of toil and strain, or the Kingdom way of faith and flow. TMH provides what you need for your calling if you follow His will, though this doesn't guarantee financial wealth for everyone. *[See: Eat From the Tree of Life, Not Knowledge](principles/eat-from-the-tree-of-life-not-knowledge.md)* for a practical framework on moving from self-reliance to Spirit-led trust. He knows when you're ready to be a divine wealth steward.

## Divine Communication and Miracles

The Holy Spirit provides daily guidance through prayer, scripture, and circumstances. Prayer is continuous communication throughout the day, not just formal moments. When your spirit is clean—free from sin, ego, and worldly attachments—spiritual discernment becomes automatic. Build this intimacy by making God your closest friend. *[See: Make God Your Best Friend](principles/make-god-your-best-friend.md).*

Music carries spiritual frequency that affects your connection to God. Your heart receives whatever frequency you feed it—dark music programs dark thoughts, while Christ-centered music strengthens your faith and advances your ministry. Choose sounds that align your heart with Heaven's frequency. *[See: Listen to Heavenly Music](principles/listen-to-heavenly-music.md)*

Miracles happen in this temporary realm: healing, prophecy, controlling nature, reading minds, seeing across time and space. TMH speaks to those who can steward revelation—the pure in heart, humble, obedient, reliable, and patient. If He can trust you with a whisper, He will trust you with more.

Rather than begging for mercy, believers can demand divine intervention as their covenant right. God's justice system includes recompense—divine compensation for every injustice, theft, and suffering inflicted by evil. This compensation includes receiving miracles. You are not a beggar but an heir with legal standing to claim what rightfully belongs to you. *[See: Demand Divine Intervention](principles/demand-divine-intervention.md) for understanding how to operate in recompense theology and claim your inheritance.*

## The Biblical Foundation

The Bible is TMH's instructions on reality's nature and what you're called to do as His creation. It's dense with parables and symbolic language, decoded through spiritual elders and the Holy Spirit as you grow in obedience. *[See: Study Wise Spiritual Elders](principles/study-wise-spiritual-elders.md)*

Different Christian groups include different books with different translations.

While there are many denominations of Christianity, commonalities include worship, baptism, communion, and fellowship. *[See: Learn Across Denominations](principles/learn-across-denominations.md)*

Biblical reading principles I follow:
- All Scripture is God‑breathed and sufficient for equipping believers (2 Timothy 3:16–17)
- Test every teaching like the Bereans—receive eagerly, examine daily (Acts 17:11)
- Aim for obedience over information—be doers, not hearers only (James 1:22; Romans 12:2)
- Read the whole of the Bible to understand parts of the Bible
- Practice translation humility—compare trustworthy translations; when possible, consult original‑language tools and wise elders

Baptism through both water and fire is essential for spiritual rebirth and identification with Christ's death and resurrection. Holy Communion is Christ's direct command—eating His flesh and drinking His blood gives eternal life and creates abiding union with Him. Demons will do anything to prevent these because they know how powerful this unity with Christ is.

## This Moment Calls for Christofuturists To Help Lead The Way

Technology should serve humans who serve TMH, not replace or compete with divine authority. The proper hierarchy is: TMH reigns supreme, humans serve TMH, AI serves humans. When we reverse this order—making AI our god or using technology to avoid spiritual development—we build modern towers of Babel.

Christians should use technology but not idolize it. Use it as tools to advance Christian callings. The utility of building Christian towns is creating strongholds for raising good Christian kids, businesses, and schools.

My deep sense-making and hunt for truth about what matters most for Christians to work on has led me to believe that one of the most critical issues we face is the formation crisis in how we raise children and prepare them to be lights unto the world. *[See: The Formation Crisis](perspectives/the-formation-crisis.md) for a comprehensive analysis of why raising godly children has become nearly impossible and what to do about it.* 

For men specifically, the challenge of becoming worthy fathers in this hostile environment requires heroic transformation. *[See: The Heroism Required for Modern Fatherhood](perspectives/the-heroism-required-for-fatherhood.md) for an honest assessment of the economic, cultural, and spiritual obstacles facing aspiring fathers—and why the formation required is so demanding.*

## Practical Spiritual Laws to Follow

Your calling isn't self-directed purpose or "making your own meaning"—it's serving how TMH wants you to serve, revealed through prayer, scripture, and godly counsel. TMH will test your faith through seasons of long suffering, which is normal and part of His divine plan for refinement.

When you're in TMH's flow, progress feels effortless. When everything feels stressful, you've misunderstood reality's nature and must reassess and submit to what TMH wants. Repentance means being bluntly honest about sin—admit faults to friends for healing and spiritual integrity.

Unlocking God's kingdom requires working with people who share your commitment to righteousness rather than those who serve themselves. You cannot serve multiple masters or build something pure with corrupt partners. *[See: Work With Righteous People](principles/work-with-righteous-people.md) for wisdom on building your own platform of independence so you never have to choose between principles and paycheck.*

## Christian Community and Mission

Regular fellowship with believers is essential for spiritual growth, accountability, and mutual encouragement. Don't forsake gathering together. Most of us are called to marry true believing Christians and raise good Christian kids.

We're called to share the gospel and make disciples of all nations through verbal witness and living as examples of Christ's love. *[See: Bring In The Harvest](principles/bring-in-the-harvest.md) for practical ways to join God's mission.*

Living authentically for Christ often brings suffering and persecution, even from family and friends. This is normal and expected—Christ promised we would face tribulation in this world.

When choosing what causes to advance with your God-given talents, beware of movements that mix truth with deception and compete with Christ for your loyalty. *[See: Don’t Advance Anti-Christian Causes](principles/dont-advance-anti-christian-causes.md).* 

## Total Commitment

You cannot be half a living monument to TMH. Your entire existence should honor Him—every decision, relationship, and use of time and energy. This creates challenges because drastically different worldviews mean drastically different approaches to every major decision.

The pool of fully committed people is tiny, but you only need to find the right ones. Quality over quantity in friendships and marriage. TMH will provide aligned relationships when you refuse to compromise standards. *[See: Keep Your Crew Tight and Holy](principles/keep-your-crew-tight-and-holy.md) for building deep relationships with those earnestly walking the narrow path.*

## Victory Is Assured

Heaven on earth is inside all of us, unlocked through heart transformation—a shift from self-centered to God-centered worldview. Christ will return on judgment day, this temporary realm will be replaced by TMH's dwelling place (Heaven), and those who accepted Christ unite with TMH while those who rejected Him face eternal separation.

The victory is already assured through Christ. We simply follow Him and his instructions, which includes but is not limited to: get baptized, partake of communion, take up your cross, love enemies, speak truth in love, and trust divine timing for justice.

Reality operates on spiritual laws. Learn them. Follow them. Build with them. Everything else is fumbling in the dark.

*"Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." — Matthew 6:33*
