# The Truth Economy

### ***Why we desperately need Christ-aligned business hubs that don't fund Satanic causes, and how Truth can become the ultimate luxury lifestyle***

![Market](../artworks/market.png)

We live in a world where billions of dollars flow daily into enterprises that actively work against Christ's kingdom. Private equity firms control the companies that provide our food, medicine, and shelter—many with stakes in defense contractors waging genocide. We fund Gwyneth Paltrow's New Age movement instead of entrepreneurs helping people walk the narrow path.

**This has to change. We need to create a Truth economy, and we need to create it ASAP.**

*"But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well." — Matthew 6:33*

## **The Current System Funds What We Oppose**

Every dollar you spend is a vote for the kind of world you want to see. Right now, most of our votes are going toward enterprises that mock God, exploit workers, and corrupt children.

Your morning coffee funds companies that promote 'pride' ideology. Your streaming subscriptions bankroll entertainment that celebrates everything Christ calls sin. Your investment portfolio likely includes shares in surveillance companies, weapons manufacturers, and pharmaceutical giants that profit from human misery.

**We've unconsciously outsourced our economic participation to systems that actively oppose our values.** *[See: Don't Advance Anti-Christian Causes](../principles/dont-advance-anti-christian-causes.md) for understanding how to discern the false lights we're inadvertently funding.*

This isn't sustainable for followers of Christ. We can't claim to love God while funding His enemies. We can't build His kingdom while enriching those who tear it down.

## **The Vision: Truth as Luxury Lifestyle**

Imagine walking into a space that feels like stepping into the future—a crystal-clear glimpse of what society could be when Truth reigns. A *Christofuture.*

Beautiful architecture, heavenly music, thoughtfully curated products from Christ-aligned entrepreneurs. Everything designed to the highest standard because **Truth deserves the best presentation.**

This isn't about making "Christian products" that feel cheap and conspiratorial. This is about making Truth feel like the luxury lifestyle it actually is. Making righteousness attractive. Making the narrow path appear as the obviously superior choice.

Right now, Truth gets associated with low-quality production and low-brow conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, lies get beautiful packaging, celebrity endorsements, and unlimited marketing budgets. 

**We need to flip this completely.**

Think of it as creating embassies of the Truth nation around the world—physical spaces where people can experience what life looks like when Christ-aligned values shape commerce, culture, and community.

## **Marketplace Ministry for the Modern Era**

![Market](../artworks/market2.png)

The early church spread through networks of believing merchants, craftsmen, and business owners. They created economic ecosystems that sustained kingdom work while meeting real human needs.

**This is historically documented:** Paul the tentmaker supported his ministry through his craft while working alongside fellow tentmakers Aquila and Priscilla (Acts 18:3). Lydia, a merchant dealing in purple cloth from Thyatira, used her home and resources to establish a gathering place for new disciples (Acts 16:14-15). These believers "utilized their trades and businesses to support and expand the Christian community," traveling along trade routes that connected the Roman Empire and creating "networks for exchanging news" that facilitated the spread of Christian teachings.¹ See also Wayne A. Meeks, The First Urban Christians.³

Early Christian communities placed "care for disenfranchised individuals at the center of their relational economy," creating support systems that stood in contrast to the hierarchical structures of the Greco-Roman world.² Their integration of faith and economic activity became a distinguishing mark that contributed to the growth and sustainability of early Christian communities.

We need the same approach today: **marketplace ministers** who understand that their businesses are extensions of their discipleship. Entrepreneurs who see profit as a tool for kingdom building, not personal empire expansion.

This means:

- **Publishers** who take brilliant but poorly packaged Truth content and give it luxury treatment—making profound spiritual insights accessible through beautiful design and distribution
- **Technology companies** that build platforms serving human flourishing instead of addiction and exploitation  
- **Food producers** who nourish bodies without compromising souls through corrupt supply chains
- **Financial services** that help families build wealth without funding anti-Christian causes
- **Media companies** that tell stories reflecting divine Truth rather than Hollywood's inversions

*[See: Work With Righteous People](../principles/work-with-righteous-people.md) for building your platform of independence so you never have to choose between principles and profit.*

## **The Multi-Trillion Dollar Opportunity**

Over the next decades, this Truth economy represents a multi-trillion dollar opportunity. But it starts with understanding that this is something that needs to be created.

Right now, Christ-aligned consumers have limited options. They're forced to choose between compromising their values or living like hermits. Meanwhile, billions of dollars in spending power goes toward enterprises that use those profits to advance Satanic agendas.

**What if we captured even a fraction of that spending and redirected it toward Truth-aligned businesses?**

- Restaurants and cafes that serve as community hubs for Truth seekers
- Fashion brands that put saints on shirts instead of rappers who glorify sin
- Publishing houses that make profound spiritual content accessible through excellent design
- Investment firms that only fund enterprises aligned with kingdom values
- Technology platforms that strengthen families instead of fragmenting them

Each successful Truth business creates jobs for other believers, generates capital for funding more Truth businesses, and demonstrates that righteousness can be profitable.

## **From Individual Marketplace Ministers to Truth Villages: The Azusa Street Pattern**

The goal isn't just creating scattered "Christian businesses." It's building an integrated ecosystem where Truth-aligned enterprises support each other, share resources, and create compounding value.

**The pattern is clear from history:** William J. Seymour's Azusa Street Revival started with one man praying up to seven hours daily in private homes, creating such a powerful center of spiritual gravity that it eventually drew seekers from around the world. What began in a humble $8/month rented building with dirt floors launched a movement that today influences over 600 million people globally. *[See: William J. Seymour](../profiles/william-j-seymour.md) for the full story of how radical humility and persistent prayer launched a worldwide revival.*

**The same pattern applies to marketplace ministry today:**

**Phase 1: Individual Calling** - A marketplace minister realizes they must take action, stop funding anti-Christian causes, and start building alternatives. Like Seymour responding to his "divine call" to Los Angeles, they feel compelled to create something new.

**Phase 2: Geographic Focus** - They choose a specific location to build a center of gravity around Truth. This might start as a pop-up shop, a single brick-and-mortar store, or even hosting Truth circles in their home—but it's a physical place people can pilgrimage to.

**Phase 3: Center of Gravity** - Through consistent excellence, authentic community, and Spirit-led operations, this location becomes known as a place where Truth reigns. Word spreads organically, just as Seymour's revival gained "free advertising" through persecution and attracted crowds through supernatural manifestations.

**Phase 4: Truth Village** - Other Truth-aligned entrepreneurs are drawn to cluster around this center of gravity, creating local economies that don't depend on corrupt global supply chains. Families relocate to live, work, and raise children surrounded by others committed to walking the narrow path.

This requires thinking beyond individual profit to **ecosystem health**:

- Shared infrastructure for manufacturing, distribution, and marketing
- Investment funds that prioritize kingdom impact alongside financial returns  
- Educational institutions that train the next generation of Truth entrepreneurs
- Media platforms that amplify Truth businesses and their stories

Just as Azusa Street's "continuous worship" ran "three times daily, seven days a week for three years" without collections or advertisements, Truth Villages must be sustained by divine provision flowing through excellent businesses rather than dependence on donations or external funding.

*[See: Keep Your Crew Tight and Holy](../principles/keep-your-crew-tight-and-holy.md) for understanding the importance of surrounding yourself with people who share your highest values.*

## **The Truth Economy Is Inevitable**

We're approaching a moment when many people are ready to turn away from systems that have disappointed and exploited them. The lies are becoming obvious. The corruption is undeniable. The spiritual emptiness of secular materialism is driving people to seek something real.

**This creates an unprecedented opportunity for Truth businesses that can offer genuine alternatives.**

The Truth economy represents the ultimate form of spiritual warfare: proving that God's way of doing business creates more value, serves people better, and builds stronger communities than Satan's alternatives.

When Truth becomes a luxury lifestyle—when righteousness is associated with world-leading excellence, beauty, and prosperity—the narrow path stops looking narrow and starts looking like the obviously superior choice.

**The Truth becomes valuable when we connect the dots.** When isolated Truth businesses link together into networks, ecosystems, and eventually entire economic regions that demonstrate God's design for human flourishing.

This won't happen overnight, but starting to point yourself in this direction today is how, by mid-century, Truth culture becomes the dominant culture around the world. Satan's grip on everything will have finally fallen.

*"For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the LORD as the waters cover the sea." — Isaiah 11:9*

This is the work of our lifetimes. This is how we create the infrastructure for our children to live, work, and raise families without constantly compromising their values.

**The Truth economy is inevitable. The only question is whether you're building it or still funding its enemies.**

If this vision resonates with you, there's infinite work to be done. **DM me on X at [@garysheng](https://x.com/garysheng)** to explore how we can collaborate.
