# Study Wise Spiritual Elders

*How did God design the universe? What is God's will for us? How should we live in light of eternal truth? These are not obvious questions with simple answers.*

You have the privilege of building your Christian foundation on elders who spent years if not decades wrestling with these mysteries. They studied Scripture deeply, endured trials that tested their faith, and emerged with tested wisdom about God's creation and His heart for humanity.

Stand on their shoulders. Let their hard-won insights become stepping stones for your journey. Why start from scratch?

## Learning From Living Mentors

If you're blessed with friendships with wise Christians who embody Christ's heart, ask who shaped them. Learn their sources.

My friend Marcus was the first spiritual mentor who fielded the direct questions I couldn’t answer by reading alone. He and his wife Arielle have been profound helps—Marcus on choosing Christ beyond cultural Christianity; Arielle on relationships and discernment. They model prophetic conviction with love. And give me good sources of Truth to dig into.

When you find elders who resonate, go deep. Study how they think, who they study, how they read Scripture, and how they navigate modern tensions.

## Some Elders Whose Wisdom Transcends Labels and Time

Here are a few examples of wise elders that have shaped me:

- Francis Schaeffer. I love the many docuseries he has created. His worldview critique lands even harder today and has strengthened my critique of secular humanism—whether "conscious capitalism," socialism, or communism—false gospels that borrow Christian morality while rejecting Christ.

- C.S. Lewis remains a gold standard for clear, compelling Christian thought that crosses denominational lines. His vision of moral realism and transformed desire still cuts through modern confusion.

- G.K. Chesterton. His apologetics and social critique show why Christianity dignifies the common person and makes democracy workable—by humbling rulers before God and restraining idolatry of power and wealth. He celebrates Christ‑likeness, challenges tyrants, and offers incisive critiques of alternative religions (including why Buddhism is not Christianity despite surface parallels).

- Frank Viola. His Christ-centered ecclesiology and writing on organic church life challenged my assumptions about institutionalism and helped me prioritize Christ’s headship over brand and structure.

- Dr. Michael Cocchini—his journey across religions and rigorous biblical reasoning are refreshing. From exploring multiple faiths to deep dives in Scripture, he offers clear apologetics that cut through modern confusion. His practical wisdom on discernment, spiritual warfare, and living counter-culturally has helped me navigate faith in a skeptical world.

- John Piper. His book "Don't Waste Your Life" inspires radical devotion to Christ over worldly pursuits. He offers wise views on AI—don't put it on a pedestal, but use it as a tool under God's sovereignty. Piper's teaching on Christian hedonism ("God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him") reframes joy as central to faith. His writings on God's sovereignty in suffering and passion for global missions have strengthened my resolve to live purposefully for eternity.

- My friend Peter Han—his Tree of Life vs. Tree of Knowledge teaching reshaped how I trust God with money and work.

No single denomination contains all the elders worth learning from. Each has profound wisdom—and serious failings. Don’t let labels limit your learning. Test teaching by Scripture and fruit, not affiliation. When you find elders who resonate, go deep.

## The Practice of Discerning Who To Learn From

**Ask yourself as you encounter spiritual teachers:**

1. **Do they embody Christ's heart or just supposed theological correctness?**
2. **Does their wisdom produce love, truth, and peace in those who follow it?**
3. **Are they willing to critique their own arguments and tradition?**

**Daily Practice:** Test every insight—book, sermon, conversation—by Scripture and fruit. Do not dismiss by source or accept uncritically.

The goal isn’t eclecticism; it’s learning from the fullness of Christ’s body with discernment.

You don’t have to figure this out alone. God has provided teachers. Find them, study them, and let their wisdom sharpen your walk with Jesus.
