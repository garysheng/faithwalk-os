## My Testimony: From Atheist to Evangelist

Like the vast majority of people in my generation, I grew up thinking that faith and reason were like oil and water. Attending a math and science academy and living in a non-religious household, I was always the skeptic, especially when it came to God. To me, faith seemed outdated, almost laughable. I carried this skepticism like a badge of honor.

My skepticism only intensified when I saw the news and read history books. Religious hypocrisy, wars and genocides in the name of God. People claiming to be spiritual but acting anything but. Time and time again I encountered peers who wore crosses but were far from Christ—engaging in every imaginable mortal sin, thinking that if they just said a few Hail Marys it would all be forgiven. It left an incredibly sour taste in my mouth, making it so easy for me to double down on my non-belief.

But even as an atheist, I had a deep yearning for purpose. Seeking purpose in anything but God, I tried to find it elsewhere, diving headfirst into causes like social justice. I even created a page that got 800,000 followers on Facebook in 2017—that page got a billion impressions that year, inflaming race wars and generating anti-cop hatred. I have to admit, I felt so alive when I was generating this outrage and chaos. I felt like I was playing, dare I say, God.

I had thousands of people waiting patiently every day for new red meat to jump on. It was so addicting. But the euphoria came crashing down when I realized I was only contributing more to the madness that I had intended to be a positive response to. I was so against Trump's election, and then I realized I was playing Trump's game, except just on the other side. And guess what the Facebook page was called? Woke Folks. You can't make that up.

I realized there was no way I wanted "Woke Folks" to be part of my life and legacy, so I totally abandoned it cold turkey. My secular way of repenting for my sins as a hyper-partisan was to co-found a nonprofit focused on empowering young people to become non-partisan democracy reformers. I had something like a religious passion for ranked choice voting and open primaries—I wanted it to be like a silver bullet. I got a high from now not just feeling superior to the Republican Party, but also the Democratic Party. But trying to build this new secular movement felt empty in a different way. *[See: Don't Advance Anti-Christian Causes](principles/dont-advance-anti-christian-causes.md) for understanding how even well-intentioned movements can become false lights.*

Speaking of feeling empty, becoming successful in my twenties by worldly standards did not fill the God-shaped hole in my heart. I landed a job at Google, was quickly promoted to software engineering lead of a small team on Google Cloud, earned a spot on Forbes 30 Under 30. But let me tell you, despite all the accolades, there was still an empty void inside of me. It's like having a decked-out mansion full of everything you once wanted as a kid, but still feeling like there's nothing meaningful inside. Ending my life was, unfortunately, a common thought that crossed my mind.

Trust me when I say that I get why we've gotten to this precarious point where rates of depression and suicide amongst young men and women are skyrocketing. We are in the middle of what I would call a meaning crisis, and those who grew up in this godless society are the collateral damage.

### The Turning Point

![Kanye](artworks/kanye.png)

In 2021, something unexpected happened. I found myself listening to Kanye West's album "Jesus is King," two years after it was already released. I don't know why I played it, but that music hit me differently. It was so beautiful that I couldn't help but wonder if it bore the mark of something—or someone—divine. Watching this music performed by Kanye's Sunday Service Choir on YouTube felt like a direct communication with the divine. I couldn't explain it any other way.

Around this time, I also met individuals who truly walked their faith—people I would never consider lukewarm Christians. People like my friend Matthew, who works with the Vatican, and Marcus, another member of Forbes 30 Under 30 who has devoted his life to Christ by becoming an ordained minister. Matthew and Marcus didn't just talk a Christly talk—they lived their faith. They took great steps to eliminate worldly temptation from their lives. They are all in on walking the divine path.

Their actions ignited a curiosity in me—a spark that had been extinguished by my many disappointing experiences with so-called Christians, lukewarm Christians in the past. That spark of curiosity turned into a flame during a miraculous healing ceremony earlier this year. Long story short, I helped someone who previously couldn't feel their legs for years feel them again for the first time. That experience shook me to my core.

After that point, I started seeing God's presence everywhere, even in the smallest things. It was as if I was seeing life in full color for the first time after living my life in just black and white. It finally hit me that no political ideology, no worldly achievement could replace the peace and purpose that the teachings of Christ offer.

My skepticism around faith began to crumble. I realized that the real risk isn't believing in God—the real risk is living as if He doesn't exist. I realized that if we don't start putting God first in our families, obediently following the teachings from the Sermon on the Mount, America and our world altogether will continue sinking into the quicksand of moral relativism, materialism, and celebrity worship.

Here's the reality: everyone worships something, whether it's themselves, money, or something else. But the only path to peace today is to worship the Most High God, the head of all existence, the divine orchestrator. *[See: Reserve the Pedestal for God](principles/reserve-the-pedestal-for-god.md) for understanding how to avoid modern idolatry.*

This realization launched me into consistent writing about faith and God's infinite relevance for our times. As people make AI their gods and America enters what feels like a tribulation period, we need God more than ever. We're approaching a dark age that will drive millions of souls to Christ.

A coming 'God Wave' will sweep across the world as human systems fail and divine truth becomes undeniable.

I feel called to be a small part of making that happen.

After all, it's in my blood. At the end of 2024, I discovered that my great-grandfather in China was a pastor during a time when Christianity faced increasing persecution. The same Spirit that sustained him through trials seems to be calling me to bear witness in our own age of spiritual warfare.

What began as musical and intellectual curiosity in 2021 has become a burning conviction: Christ is not just historically true—He is the answer our generation desperately needs. And truth without action is meaningless. That's why I don't just believe in Christ—I follow Him.

**Disclaimer:** To whatever extent the following evidence and arguments resonate with you and compel action, I give all glory and credit to God. Any mistakes, improper arguments, or shortcomings in this analysis are entirely my responsibility. I remain open to your feedback and correction, as I am still learning and growing in my journey of following Christ.

## Why I Follow: The Evidence That Compelled Action

My personal journey led me to investigate the intellectual foundations for faith. What I discovered was that following Christ rests on multiple converging lines of evidence and argument that demand not just mental assent, but life transformation. While my heart was moved by experience, my mind was convinced by reason, and my will was compelled to action. Here's the comprehensive case that not only convinced my intellect but transformed how I live:

## I. The Philosophical Foundation
*The rational arguments that provide the intellectual scaffolding for belief.*

As I began investigating the claims of Christianity, I discovered that faith wasn't the enemy of reason—it was reason's natural culmination. The philosophical arguments for God's existence provided the logical foundation I needed as a skeptical engineer.

### The Cosmological Argument
*Why the existence of anything at all points to God.*

The universe had a beginning—this isn't just biblical teaching, it's confirmed by modern cosmology. The [Kalam Cosmological Argument](https://convincingproof.org/first-cause-argument/) follows simple logic:
- Everything that begins to exist has a cause
- The universe began to exist (supported by Big Bang cosmology)
- Therefore, the universe has a cause

This cause must be spaceless, timeless, immaterial, incredibly powerful, and intelligent—characteristics that align perfectly with the God of Christianity. Einstein's general relativity and Hubble's observations support the premise that [the universe had a beginning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument).

But the mere existence of the universe wasn't the only thing that caught my attention as an engineer. The intricate precision of how everything works together suggested something even more profound.

![Earth](artworks/earth.png)

### The Design Argument
*How the fine-tuning of reality reveals an intelligent architect.*

The intricate complexity and apparent purposefulness in nature point to an intelligent designer. Consider:
- The [fine-tuning of physical constants](https://philosophytalk.org/blog/fine-tuning-argument-god/) that allow life to exist
- The informational content in DNA
- The precise calibration of cosmic conditions
- The mathematical describability of the universe itself

The fine-tuning is extraordinary—if fundamental constants like gravity and electromagnetic forces were altered even slightly, [life would be impossible](https://www.reasonablefaith.org/archived-forums/index.php?topic=6058838.0). The mathematical precision required suggests intentional design rather than random chance.

### The Word-Based Universe
*How information reveals the fundamental nature of reality.*

Perhaps most compelling to me as an engineer is what [John Lennox calls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gKCwldMZS8&t=5422s&ab_channel=AlexO%27Connor) the "word-based universe." The opening of John's Gospel—"In the beginning was the Word"—isn't just theology; it's describing the informational foundation of reality itself.

Consider that Einstein himself was puzzled by what he called "the most incomprehensible thing about the universe"—that it's comprehensible at all. Why should the universe be mathematically describable? Why can we use the language of mathematics to understand physical laws?

The answer becomes clear when we recognize that information is fundamental to reality, yet information itself is non-material. As Lennox notes, "if information is not in the end material, then no material explanation is going to work for it." The DNA molecule isn't just complex—it's linguistically complex, containing a 3.4 billion letter word in a chemical alphabet where every letter must be in precisely the right order.

This represents what may be the death blow to materialism, as physics itself demonstrates that information cannot be reduced to mere physics and chemistry. We live in an information-based universe that points directly to an intelligent, communicating Creator—the Word through whom all things were made.

Just as compelling to me personally was the question that had haunted my activist days: why did I feel so strongly that some things were truly right or wrong? This led me to what many consider the most powerful philosophical argument for God.

### The Moral Argument
*Why objective right and wrong can only exist if God exists.*

Without God, objective moral values cannot exist—they become merely subjective preferences. Yet we all intuitively know that some things are truly right or wrong. The [moral argument](https://ses.edu/the-moral-argument-for-gods-existence/) demonstrates:
- If God does not exist, then objective moral values do not exist
- Objective moral values do exist
- Therefore, God exists

This isn't just philosophical speculation—it explains why my activism felt empty when divorced from transcendent purpose.

### Christ as Logos: The Ultimate Decision-Making Framework
*Why following Christ makes reality intelligible and actionable.*

Of all the philosophical foundations for following Christ, perhaps none has been more practically transformative than understanding Christ as the Logos—the divine Word and rational principle that makes reality coherent and actionable.

When John's Gospel declares "In the beginning was the Word [Logos]," it reveals that Christ is the divine reason that orders and makes sense of everything. This isn't theological abstraction—it's the most practical truth I've discovered.

#### The Coherence Problem and Solution

Before following Christ, I experienced the fundamental coherence problem of secular living: without an objective foundation for truth, beauty, and goodness, life becomes endless contradictory signals and competing frameworks. The result is existential chaos disguised as progress.

The more I understand Christ and His teachings, the more sense everything makes. Following Christ provides "divine sense-making infrastructure"—a foundational operating system that orders reality, enables proper discernment of truth from falsehood, guides decision-making, detects cultural deception, and creates life coherence under one framework.

#### Practical Framework in Action

Trying to see reality as Christ might see it transforms how I approach everything. Every major decision—career, relationships, investments, priorities—gets evaluated through one question: How does this align with following Christ? This eliminates the paralysis of infinite options and cuts through competing cultural pressures.

It's why I can confidently pursue building Christian communities and Truth-centered technology without worrying about secular approval. Unlike secular frameworks I've tried (humanism, activism, stoicism), which either rely on finite human reason, assume materialistic foundations, or fail under pressure, Christ as Logos provides objective truth independent of human consensus or cultural trends.

This is perhaps the most compelling reason I follow Christ: He doesn't just provide salvation for the afterlife—He makes this life intelligible, purposeful, and actionable in ways no other framework can achieve.

## II. The Historical Evidence
*The documented facts that demonstrate Christianity's truth claims.*

While philosophy provided the logical foundation, I needed more than abstract arguments. As someone trained in data analysis, I wanted concrete, verifiable evidence. What I found in the historical record was nothing short of remarkable.

### Fulfilled Prophecy
*How predictions made centuries in advance came true with mathematical precision.*

The accuracy of biblical prophecies provides compelling evidence for divine authorship. Consider:
- [Daniel's detailed predictions](https://reasons.org/explore/publications/articles/fulfilled-prophecy-evidence-for-the-reliability-of-the-bible) of Middle Eastern empires spanning five centuries
- [Over 300 Messianic prophecies](https://www.yourlivingword.com/the-meaning-of-life/blog/proving-the-accuracy-and-reliability-of-the-bible-through-prophecy) fulfilled in Jesus Christ
- Statistical calculations showing the probability of chance fulfillment as [astronomically small](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/advent-statistical-probability-jesus-fulfilling-messianic-george) (1 in 10^157 for multiple prophecies)

The [Dead Sea Scrolls](https://www.growingchristians.org/christian-evidences/are-biblical-prophecies-accurate) confirm these prophecies were written centuries before their fulfillment, eliminating post-facto additions.

But of all the historical claims of Christianity, none is more central—or more thoroughly documented—than the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This single event, if true, changes everything.

### The Resurrection
*Why the best-attested miracle in history demands a response.*

Multiple lines of [historical evidence](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/historical-evidence-for-the-resurrection) support Jesus' resurrection:
- The empty tomb discovered by women (whose testimony was considered unreliable in first-century Judaism)
- Post-resurrection appearances to multiple witnesses
- The transformation of disciples from fearful followers to bold martyrs
- The early creedal formula in 1 Corinthians 15, dating within 3-5 years of the crucifixion
- The failure of contemporary opponents to produce Jesus' body

Even [skeptical scholars acknowledge](https://peacefulscience.org/articles/daniel-ang-a-scientist-looks-at-the-resurrection/) the basic historical facts surrounding Jesus' death and the disciples' belief in his resurrection.

## III. The Experiential Evidence
*The personal encounters that make faith real and transformative.*

While historical and philosophical arguments convinced my mind, it was personal experience that captured my heart. The transformation I witnessed—both in myself and others—provided a different kind of evidence, one that speaks to the deepest parts of human existence.

### Religious Experience and Transformation
*How encounters with the divine change lives in measurable ways.*

My own experience mirrors countless others who have encountered the divine. The [argument from religious experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_religious_experience) includes:
- Dramatic life changes following religious conversion
- Former atheists becoming believers based on personal experience
- Consistent reports of divine encounters across cultures and time periods
- The transformative power of Christian faith in addressing addiction, depression, and other life challenges

### Experience Often Precedes Arguments
*Why intellectual reasons frequently follow personal encounters with God.*

As Oxford mathematician [John Lennox observes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gKCwldMZS8&t=5422s&ab_channel=AlexO%27Connor), "Intellectually one's reasons for God often come after one's experience of God." This insight resonates deeply with my own journey—the philosophical arguments I've outlined here largely came after my personal encounter with divine reality, not before.

This pattern reveals something profound about how God works. If faith required mastering complex philosophical arguments first, as Lennox notes, "I would doubt whether that God was worth believing in." Instead, God meets people where they are—the Oxford professor and the illiterate former boxer alike can encounter the same transformative truth.

Lennox shares the story of Stan Ford, an ex-fairground heavyweight boxer who "couldn't read or write" but became a Christian at 19 and later "could give you a summary by heart of every chapter in the Bible." Stan became "a living example of what God can do to a person," demonstrating that divine encounter transcends educational background or intellectual sophistication.

But personal transformation wasn't the only experiential evidence I encountered. The miraculous healing I participated in opened my eyes to a realm of divine intervention that continues today.

### Modern Miracles and Healings
*Why supernatural interventions still occur in the contemporary world.*

![Healing](artworks/healing.png)

Contemporary accounts of [miraculous healings](https://simonguillebaud.com/stunning-modern-day-miracles/) continue to be reported:
- Medically documented healings with no natural explanation
- Miraculous rescues and interventions
- Answers to prayer that defy statistical probability
- Mass evangelistic events accompanied by supernatural phenomena

My own experience with the healing ceremony fits this pattern of modern miraculous intervention.

Another category of experiential evidence that particularly intrigued me as someone interested in consciousness and the nature of reality came from studying near-death experiences.

### Near-Death Experiences
*What happens when people encounter the divine at the threshold of death.*

Research into [near-death experiences](https://christianscholars.com/near-death-experiences-and-the-emerging-implications-for-christian-theology/) reveals common elements aligning with Christian theology:
- Encounters with a being of light identified as Jesus
- Experiences of unconditional love and peace
- Life reviews and spiritual insights
- Consistent themes across diverse cultural backgrounds
- Transformative effects leading to increased faith and moral behavior

Studies suggest NDEs occur in roughly [4% of the population](https://www.destinyimage.com/blog/john-burke-the-most-intriguing-near-death-experience-i-ever-heard) who have been clinically dead and resuscitated.

## IV. Christianity's Unique Claims
*How Christianity stands apart from all other religious systems.*

As I investigated various world religions during my journey, I needed to understand what made Christianity distinctive. The differences weren't just theological—they were fundamental to the nature of God and humanity's relationship with Him.

### What Sets Christianity Apart
*Why Christianity's core message is unlike any other religion.*

Several factors distinguish Christianity from other world religions:
- The concept of grace rather than works-based salvation
- God taking the initiative to reach humanity rather than humans earning divine favor
- The historical specificity of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection
- The [rapid, peaceful spread](https://reasons.org/explore/blogs/reflections/ten-reasons-for-the-rapid-spread-of-christianity-part-1-social-factors) of early Christianity despite persecution

One of the biggest intellectual obstacles I faced as a skeptic was the problem of evil. How could a good God allow suffering? Rather than avoiding this question, I found that Christianity provides the most satisfactory response.

### The Problem of Evil
*Why suffering doesn't disprove God—it actually points to Him.*

Rather than undermining faith, the problem of evil has [theological responses](https://theartofgodliness.com/blog/202234/theodicy-answering-the-problem-of-evil):
- The free will defense: Evil results from human moral choices
- The greater good theodicy: God permits evil to achieve greater goods
- The soul-making theodicy: Suffering develops character and spiritual growth
- The eschatological response: Ultimate justice and restoration in the afterlife

The existence of evil actually presupposes objective moral standards, which point to God as their source.

## V. The Mathematical Evidence
*How the numbers reveal the impossibility of coincidence.*

As someone with a background in data analysis, I was particularly drawn to the statistical arguments for God's existence. When you run the numbers, the probability of our universe and Christianity's claims being the result of chance becomes virtually zero.

### Statistical Improbabilities
*Why the math strongly favors divine intervention over random chance.*

The mathematical improbability of various phenomena provides additional support:
- The fine-tuning of cosmic constants
- The fulfillment of biblical prophecies
- The complexity of biological information systems
- The statistical improbability of early Christianity's success without divine intervention

## VI. Problems with Naturalistic Alternatives
*Why secular explanations fall short of explaining reality.*

My scientific training taught me to consider alternative hypotheses. When I examined the naturalistic explanations for life, consciousness, and morality, I found them lacking in explanatory power.

### Limitations of Natural Selection
*How Darwin's theory fails to account for complex biological systems.*

Significant scholarly criticism has emerged regarding [natural selection's adequacy](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4594354/):
- Natural selection can function as a circular or tautological argument
- The theory lacks predictive power except in simple circumstances
- Complex biological structures appear to require coordinated changes that random processes cannot adequately explain
- Evolution depends on the existence of life and cannot explain life's origin

### The Systems Biology Problem
*How the interdependence of biological systems defies gradualistic explanations.*

As [John Lennox points out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gKCwldMZS8&t=5422s&ab_channel=AlexO%27Connor), we face a fundamental chicken-and-egg problem in biology: "You can't get DNA without a cell. You can't get a living cell without DNA." This systems biology challenge reveals the inadequacy of step-by-step evolutionary explanations for life's origin.

Evolution, whatever it does or doesn't do, "depends on the existence of life to do anything. So it cannot be the explanation for life." The information systems within living cells—particularly the linguistic complexity of DNA that even Richard Dawkins acknowledges cannot be generated by random processes—point to intelligent causation rather than undirected natural forces.

These limitations suggest the need for [alternative explanations](https://darwinthenandnow.com/understanding-evolution/theory-and-consensus/natural-selection/natural-selection-critics/) involving intelligent design.

---

## Conclusion: The Cumulative Case for Following Christ
*How all the evidence points to one inescapable truth that demands response.*

My journey from atheism to following Christ wasn't based on a single argument or experience—it was the cumulative weight of evidence from multiple sources that compelled not just belief, but action. The philosophical arguments provided the intellectual foundation, the historical evidence demonstrated Christianity's truth claims, the experiential evidence made it personal, and the statistical evidence showed the mathematical improbability of alternatives.

Modern Christian apologetics employs this [cumulative case approach](https://applygodsword.com/apologetics-arguments-4-arguments-anyone-can-use-for-the-existence-of-god/), arguing that multiple lines of evidence together provide compelling reasons not just for belief, but for following Christ:
- Natural theology arguments (cosmological, teleological, moral)
- Historical evidence for Christianity's central claims
- Personal and testimonial evidence
- The explanatory power of theism in addressing ultimate questions
- The pragmatic benefits of religious faith

The evidence ranges from abstract philosophical arguments to concrete historical claims, from personal testimonies to scientific observations, creating a comprehensive framework that addresses both intellectual and experiential dimensions of human existence.

This multifarious approach helps explain why following Christ continues to attract adherents across diverse cultural, educational, and social backgrounds who are willing to let truth transform their lives. It's why a former atheist engineer from Google can find himself compelled not just to believe, but to reorder his entire existence around the same Truth that has transformed lives for two millennia.

Everyone worships something. The question isn't whether you'll have faith—it's what you'll place your faith in and how you'll live it out. After years of investigation, meditation, and prayer, I've found that only following Christ provides the peace, purpose, and truth that my soul was searching for.

The real risk isn't believing in God. The real risk is living as if He doesn't exist—or believing in Him without allowing that belief to transform how you actually live.

---

*This testimony represents my personal journey and the evidence that compelled me to action. Whether you're skeptical or genuinely curious, I invite you to investigate these claims for yourself—not just intellectually, but practically. Life is full of surprises, especially if you keep an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart willing to be transformed.*

*God bless you.*
