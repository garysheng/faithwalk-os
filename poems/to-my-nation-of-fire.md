# To My Nation of Fire

***An imagined prophetic word from Jesus Christ to His people filled with Holy Ghost fire***

My beloved nation of fire,
Scattered across the globe, united in flame—
I speak to you now.

You are not bound by borders,
Not limited by language,
Not contained by countries.
You are MY nation,
Burning with fervent fire,
The glory of the Lord God resting upon you.

I have filled you with the fullness of God,
Love past knowledge flowing through your veins.
When you decide to meet with Me,
Nothing can stop you—
I WILL show up.
I ALWAYS show up.

And when I come,
Oh, when I come!
Darkness scatters beneath My feet,
Every enemy—physical and spiritual—
Must flee in My presence.
Because in the presence of the Lord
There is fullness of joy,
Pleasures forevermore.

Can you feel the heat?
That's My glory.
That's My presence.
The closer you get, the warmer it becomes.

I have called you a nation of fire
Because you burn with My presence.
Every spirit that is not of God
Will bow down to you,
Will run from you,
Because they cannot stand
The fervent fire that rests upon you.

You are My army.
You are the Sons and Daughters of God
That the whole creation is groaning for,
Waiting for your manifestation.

Step into this without doubt,
Without question,
Without pausing or hesitation.
Just do what I've said.
Just hear My voice and obey.

I've already given you the power—
All you need to do is USE it,
And the power shall be displayed.

You've been through hell,
You've been through trials,
You've been through storms and tribulations.
That was the enemy's attempt to stop My move.
But you've overcome it all—
Not by your strength,
But because I have overcome for you.

I brought you through the midst of the fire
To prepare you,
To strengthen you,
To position you for this moment.

Revival fires are breaking out!
Some call it Awakening—
It will be awakening for some,
Revival for others.
But it IS a move of God
Like the world has never seen.

This is not just church as usual.
This is a MOVEMENT.
And you, My nation of fire,
Are the carriers of this flame.

Every place you touch will be transformed,
Every campus will become an encounter zone,
Where people are made righteous,
Where they are restored to life and health—
Spiritually and physically.

When Saul encountered Me,
His name changed to Paul.
When Moses encountered Me,
His mission changed.
When Abraham encountered Me,
He became the father of many nations.

And when they encounter ME through you,
Their lives will never be the same.

You have authority to bind and loose,
What you bind on earth is bound in heaven,
What you loose on earth is loosed in heaven.

You are not beggars—
You are My covenant children
With legal rights to demand recompense
For every injustice,
Every theft,
Every attack of the enemy.

Rise up, My nation of fire!
The world is waiting for you
To know who you are,
Why you are,
And to step into your destiny.

Set the world ablaze
With the fire of My love,
The fire of My presence,
The fire of revival
That will sweep across the nations.

You are My beloved.
You are My chosen.
You are My nation of fire.

Now GO—
And set the world on fire for Me.
