# Recognize and Resist Sinfrastructure

*Dating apps that commodify connection. Social media that monetizes envy, wrath, and pride. Sports betting apps that turn phones into casinos.*

What do we call technology and laws that make sin feel natural, accessible, and profitable while making righteousness feel difficult, outdated, and heroic?

"Satanic infrastructure" or "sinfrastructure."

The value of naming these systems is that when you can identify the system, you can choose to stop building them and stop participating in their growth.

Unlike overt persecution of Christians, sinfrastructure operates through convenience, normalization, and economic incentives. It doesn't ban Christianity; it makes Christian living impractical. It doesn't outlaw virtue; it makes vice more profitable.

The genius is that most people don't recognize they're immersed in a system designed to make them fall. They think their struggles with temptation are simply personal failures rather than engineered outcomes.

## The Technology of Temptation

Three examples show how modern technology systemically makes sin easier:

### Gambling Everywhere
Sports betting apps use casino psychology on your phone. States legalized mobile gambling to capture tax revenue, creating millions of new addicts. DraftKings and FanDuel employ the same variable reward schedules that make slot machines addictive. Crypto exchanges operate as 24/7 global casinos disguised as "investing platforms." Even video games now include loot boxes—gambling mechanics targeting children.

### Algorithmic Lust Delivery
Social media algorithms are trained to maximize engagement, which means delivering increasingly provocative content. Instagram's "Explore" page becomes a personalized lust delivery system. TikTok's algorithm learns your weaknesses and feeds them systemically. Dating apps are designed to keep you swiping, not to help you find lasting relationships. The more desperate and lonely you become, the more profitable you are.

### Chemical Dependency Normalization
Cannabis legalization prioritizes tax revenue over spiritual health. Psychedelic therapy reframes drug use as medical treatment. Antidepressants are prescribed before examining spiritual emptiness. Alcohol delivery apps eliminate friction from drinking alone. The legal system increasingly treats chemical dependency as solution rather than symptom of disconnection from God.

## My Experience With Sinfrastructure And Why I Am Trying To Cut It Out Of My Life

I spent years contributing to these systems before recognizing what I was doing.

- As a content creator, I built huge audiences through outrage and controversy. I knew the engagement mechanics—anger drives clicks, controversy builds followings. It was addicting and made me feel powerful, but I eventually realized I was weaponizing people's worst impulses for profit.

- In crypto, I spent multiple years encouraging people to speculate on digital assets. The industry became exhausting because almost everyone defaulted to the same greed-driven behaviors. No matter how sophisticated the technology claims, it always devolved into gambling addiction disguised as "building the future."

- With my addictive personality, the accessibility of substances became a spiritual trap. Alcohol everywhere in cities like New York. Psychedelics reframed as "healing" and "consciousness expansion." Any dependency can be spun as empowerment or self-discovery, but the result is the same—disconnection from God through chemical substitutes.

Sinfrastructure makes falling so much easier. Each platform or law promises a better life but delivers bondage.

I've tried to cut it out of my life because I recognized my own spiritual deterioration. American society has systemically fallen into what I call "infrastructure-enabled sin"—where falling becomes easier generation by generation, and virtue requires superhuman effort.

## Recognition and Resistance

Ask these diagnostic questions about any platform or policy:

1. **Does this make sin easier or harder?**
2. **Does this profit from human weakness?**
3. **Does this build community or isolate individuals?**
4. **Does this point toward God or away from Him?**

Sinfrastructure thrives when unrecognized. When we name it clearly, we can choose differently.

If you're a technologist, build infrastructure that makes following Christ easier rather than systemically harder.
