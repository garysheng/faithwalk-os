## What Motivated His Devotion to Christ

William Seymour was born the son of formerly enslaved parents in Louisiana. After losing sight in one eye to smallpox, he experienced a profound spiritual awakening that transformed his life from survivor to servant. His journey took him through Baptist and Catholic traditions before finding the holiness movement in Indianapolis and Cincinnati, where he experienced sanctification. The defining moment came in Houston, where he studied under Charles F. Parham - though segregation forced him to listen to lessons from the hallway rather than sit with white students.

This humiliation didn't embitter Seymour; instead, it deepened his dependence on God. Parham later called him "the most humble man I ever met." When invited to Los Angeles by a small group of believers, Seymour felt a divine calling: "It was divine call that brought me from Houston Texas to Los Angeles. The Lord put it into heart of one of the Saints in Los Angeles to write to me that she felt the Lord would have me come over there and do a work."

## How He Thrived While Keeping God First

**Radical Humility:** Despite being locked out of his first pulpit after just one week in Los Angeles, Seymour responded with increased prayer - up to seven hours daily. He maintained "helpless dependence on God" and was described as "simple hearted as a little child."

**Spirit-Led Leadership:** At Azusa Street, Seymour typically sat behind two shoe boxes with his head bowed in prayer during services. He led not through charisma but through yielding - letting the Holy Spirit direct every meeting. "These are Holy Ghost meetings and no flesh can glory in the presence of our God."

**Humble Venues:** Started in private homes on Bonnie Brae Street, then moved to a small, fire-damaged building on Azusa Street that cost $8/month to rent. The dirt floors and plain wooden altar became the launching pad for a worldwide movement.

**Supernatural Manifestations:** The revival featured speaking in tongues, divine healings, prophetic words, and heavenly choirs. Crutches and canes filled the upstairs walls as testimonies to God's healing power.

**Racial Unity:** In segregated 1906 America, Azusa Street became a place where "colored people and a sprinkling of whites" worshipped together in unprecedented harmony. This unity was itself seen as miraculous.

**Continuous Worship:** Services ran three times daily, seven days a week for three years. "The place was never closed and it was never empty." No collections were taken, no advertisements posted - everything flowed from God's presence.

**Global Impact:** What began in a humble building spawned dozens of denominations and today influences over 600 million Pentecostals worldwide. "It began there but it spread to the whole world."

**Persecution With Purpose:** When newspapers mocked them as a "weird Babel of tongues," Seymour remained unshaken. "The newspapers ridiculed and abused the meetings but they gave us free advertising... outside persecution never hurt the work instead it brings crowds."
