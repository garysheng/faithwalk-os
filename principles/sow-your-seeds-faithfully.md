# Sow Your Seeds Faithfully

*"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom." — Luke 6:38*

God's financial system operates on seedtime and harvest, not salaries and wages. When you understand the spiritual laws of sowing and reaping, you move from employee mindset to kingdom investor mindset. Your tithes and offerings become seeds that multiply supernaturally.

This isn't about getting rich quick—it's about partnering with God's economy. The same God who multiplies agricultural seeds will multiply your financial seeds when sown in faith and obedience.

## The Tithe: Your Covenant Foundation

**Tithing isn't Old Testament law—it's New Testament covenant.** Hebrews 7:8 makes this clear: "And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them." When you bring your tithe to church, mortal men receive it, but Jesus receives it spiritually.

The tithe (10% of your gross income) doesn't belong to you—it belongs to God. It's already His when you earn it. He puts it in your hands to test your heart and establish covenant with you. When you give it faithfully, you gain "tither's rights"—spiritual legal standing that gives you authority over the devil in financial matters.

**Tither's Rights Include:**
- Protection from financial devastation
- Authority to demand sevenfold return when the devil steals
- Access to supernatural provision and multiplication
- Divine favor in employment and business dealings

Supporting scriptures: Malachi 3:10–11; Proverbs 6:30–31; 2 Corinthians 9:6–8; Luke 6:38.

> "When the devil steals from you, you go, 'No, devil. You cannot. You are a liar. I declare sevenfold return back unto me.' You will always get it because you have a right as a tither."

## Beyond the Tithe: Sowing Offering Seeds

While the tithe establishes your covenant standing, **offerings are where multiplication happens**. Offerings are seeds you sow in faith, expecting supernatural harvest.

The principle is simple: whatever measure you give determines what measure you receive back. Give in a cup, receive in a cup. Give in a wheelbarrow, receive in wheelbarrows. There are no limits when you understand God's multiplication system.

**Key Sowing Principles:**
- Sow into gospel ministries and kingdom work
- Speak over your seeds—declare what you expect them to produce
- Give with expectation, not just obligation
- The size of your seed determines the size of your harvest (2 Corinthians 9:6)

> "If you give in a cup, then you're going to get back in a cup. If you give in a bucket full, then you get back a bucket full. Whatever measure you give, you mete shall be measured unto you."

## The Multiplication Mechanism

God doesn't just return what you give—He multiplies it through people and supernatural provision. Scripture promises "shall men give into your bosom"—meaning God moves on human hearts to bless you financially.

This happens through:
- Unexpected bonuses and raises
- Business opportunities and contracts
- Gifts and inheritances
- Supernatural provision (money appearing in accounts)
- Favor in negotiations and purchases

The key is understanding that **God uses people as His delivery system** for your harvest. When you sow seeds faithfully, you activate a spiritual law that compels blessing to flow back to you through human channels.

## Why Recompense Requires Covenant Standing

The sevenfold return and recompense principles work specifically for those in covenant with God through tithing. This isn't about earning God's love—it's about legal spiritual standing.

Just as earthly courts only recognize certain legal standings, heaven's economy operates on covenant principles. When you tithe faithfully, you establish legal standing that gives you authority to demand justice and recompense from the devil.

**Without tithing:** You're asking for mercy and hoping for blessing.
**With tithing:** You're claiming legal rights and demanding covenant benefits.

This is why the pastor emphasizes tither's rights so strongly—it's the difference between begging and claiming what legally belongs to you as God's covenant partner.

## Practical Application

**Start with the tithe:** Give 10% of your gross income faithfully, establishing your covenant standing with God.

**Sow offering seeds strategically:** Beyond your tithe, sow additional offerings into gospel ministries, expecting supernatural multiplication.

**Speak over your seeds:** Declare Deuteronomy 8:18 over your offerings: "Father, it is You who give me power to get wealth."

**Expect supernatural provision:** Look for God to move through people, opportunities, and supernatural means to bring your harvest.

**Claim your tither's rights:** When the devil tries to steal financially, declare your covenant standing and demand sevenfold return.

## Recognition and Practice

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Am I tithing faithfully from my gross income, or making excuses?**
2. **Do I give offerings with expectation of harvest, or just obligation?**
3. **Am I speaking faith over my seeds, or giving silently?**
4. **Do I understand my legal standing as a tither, or am I begging for mercy?**
5. **Am I looking for God to use people to bless me financially?**

**This week:**
- Calculate your exact tithe (10% of gross income) and give it faithfully
- Sow an offering seed beyond your tithe, declaring what you expect it to produce
- Pray over your giving using the [Tithe and Offering Prayer](../prayers/tithe-and-offering-prayer.md)
- Study the covenant of salt (Numbers 18:19) to understand why tithing never expires
- Claim your tither's rights when facing any financial attack or shortage
