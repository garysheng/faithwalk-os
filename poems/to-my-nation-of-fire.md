# To My Nation of Fire

***An imagined prophetic word from Jesus Christ to His people filled with Holy Ghost fire***

My beloved nation of fire,
Scattered across the globe, united in flame—
I speak to you now.

You are not bound by borders,
Not limited by language,
Not contained by countries.
You are MY nation,
Burning with holy fire,
The glory of the Lord God resting upon you.

I have filled you with the fullness of my Father,
Love beyond any knowledge flowing through your veins.
When you decide to meet with Me,
Nothing can stop you—
I WILL show up.
I ALWAYS show up.

I have called you a nation of fire
Because you burn with My presence.
Every spirit that is not of God
Will bow down to you,
Will run from you,
Because they cannot stand
The holy fire that rests upon you.

You are My army.
You are the Sons and Daughters of my Father
That all of creation is groaning for,
Waiting for your manifestation.

Step into this without doubt,
Without question,
Without pausing or hesitation.
Just do what I've said.
Just hear My voice and obey.

I've already given you the power—
All you need to do is USE it,
And the power shall be displayed.

You've been through hell,
You've been through trials,
You've been through storms and tribulations.
That was the enemy's attempt to stop My move.
But you've overcome it all—
Not by your strength,
But because I have overcome for you.

I designed your walk
To prepare you,
To strengthen you,
To position you for this moment.

Revival fires will break out!
And those fires will glorify my Father
In a way the world has never seen.
And you, My nation of fire,
Are the carriers of this revival flame.

Every place you touch will be transformed,
Every campus will become an encounter zone,
Where people are made righteous,
Where they are restored to life and health—
Spiritually and physically.

When Saul encountered Me,
His name changed to Paul.
When Moses encountered Me,
His mission changed.
When Abraham encountered Me,
He became the father of many nations.

And when they encounter ME through you,
Their lives will never be the same.

I gave you authority to bind and loose—
What you bind on earth is bound in heaven,
What you loose on earth is loosed in heaven.

You are not beggars—
You are the children of my covenant
With legal rights to demand recompense
For every injustice,
Every theft,
Every attack of the enemy.

Rise up, My nation of fire!
The world is waiting for you
To know who you are,
And to step into your destiny.

Set the world ablaze
With the fire of My love,
The fire of My presence,
The fire of revival
That will sweep across the nations.

You are My beloved.
You are My chosen.

Now GO—
And set the world on fire for Me.
