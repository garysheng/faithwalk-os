# Grateful for Your Molding

***A prayer of gratitude for God's perfect process, even when we cannot see His ways***

Father,

I cannot see with Your eyes,
But I trust Your hands upon my life.

Your ways are not my ways.
What looks like loss to me
Is liberation in Your sight.
What feels like death to me
Is deliverance in Your plan.

When You take away what I treasure,
You're freeing me from idols.
When You close the door I want,
You're saving me from destruction.

I am grateful
For every person who has wronged me,
For every door You've closed,
For every comfort You've removed.

They have been gifts—
Painful gifts that taught me grace.

The most difficult seasons of my life
Have been the ones where I've grown the most.

Protect me, Lord, from constant ease,
From comfort that makes me weak,
From blessings that make me forget You.

Everything I have comes from You.
The only thing I truly own is my sin,
And even that You're working to remove.

So I thank You
For the times You've said no,
For the suffering You've allowed.

Your molding process is good,
Even when I cannot see it,
Even when it hurts.

In the age to come,
I know I'll thank You most
For the times You let me suffer,
Because I'll finally see
How much it saved my soul.

Until then, Father,
I choose gratitude over bitterness,
Trust over understanding,
Your will over my comfort.

Your ways are perfect,
Even when they're painful.

Amen.
