# The Narrow Path

*A poem about following Christ as Logos and finding divine flow*

---

Among the trillion paths I could have walked,
Through thousands of daily choices made,
One narrow way emerges as I've talked
With Him whose wisdom will not fade.

Free will feels overwhelming at the start—
Infinite versions of myself could be,
But Christ as Logos speaks within my heart:
"There's only one choice that will set you free."

Options glitter, promising the best,
A thousand mirage-doors that might have been;
Their dazzle puts my faith to the test—
Which path leads out, which deeper in?

But here's the comfort I have found:
He didn't leave us here alone
To figure out on hallowed ground
What seeds of righteousness are sown.

He designed me with a purpose true,
A calling specific, meant for me.
As I trust Him, He reveals what's new—
Who I am, who I'm meant to be.

The right feels right when pride subsides,
When ego's voice grows soft and still.
His Spirit in my spirit guides—
One choice aligns with His good will.

The world presents ten thousand ways
To get what it says I'm longing for,
But following Him through all my days
Reveals the one and narrow door.

In flow, His presence guides the wheel,
When self-consciousness melts away.
This harmony is what feels real—
Christ's Way becoming my today.

To see as He sees, think His thoughts,
To act as He would in my place,
Not claiming the perfection brought
By His redeeming, saving grace.

But opening to the Truth He is—
The Logos ordering all things right,
Where every moment becomes His,
And narrow paths lead into light.

To walk with Christ is more than faith—
It's life remade from deep within,
Where every step along His path
Becomes the place where grace begins.

*"Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."* — Matthew 7:13-14
