## What Motivated His Devotion to Christ

Tom Bancroft's faith journey was tested and refined through his 12-year career at Disney during the 1990s and 2000s. Working on classics like *The Lion King*, *Aladdin*, *Pocahontas*, and *Mulan* (where he created Mushu the dragon), Tom initially defended Disney's content when questioned by his sister's church about the company's direction.

The pivotal moment came during production of the short film *John Henry*. When Disney executives said the subtle Christian elements - including a cross on a church - made them "feel uncomfortable," Tom experienced a spiritual awakening. Despite being asked to remove Christian references while previous films like *Mulan* freely depicted ancestor worship, Tom realized he could no longer compromise his faith for his career.

"That was the day that looking back was what started me on the path of not wanting to... Six months later, I left Disney."

This led him to Big Idea Productions (VeggieTales), where he experienced the freedom to pray openly before meetings - a stark contrast to Disney's environment where "you can kind of get talked to for doing that kind of stuff."

## How He's Thriving While Keeping God First

**Courageous Career Transition:** Tom left his dream job as a supervising animator at Disney to join VeggieTales, choosing faith over financial security. When Big Idea went bankrupt, he moved to Franklin, Tennessee, to start his own company rather than return to Disney's compromising environment.

**Kingdom-Centered Business:** As CEO of Pencilish Animation Studios, Tom operates with clear faith boundaries while serving diverse clients including Disney, Warner Brothers, and Marvel. He describes his company as focused on "edifying content" that often includes strong faith elements.

**Artistic Excellence with Purpose:** Tom brings Disney-level quality to Christian projects, most notably co-directing *Light of the World* - a 2D animated feature about Jesus told from young John's perspective. "I was sold because I'm like, you just said the '90s Disney version of making a story about Jesus."

**Faithful Stewardship of Talent:** Rather than hiding his faith, Tom has learned to integrate it naturally into his work and public platform. On his podcast with his brother, sharing their faith journey became "one of our most sought-after favorite episodes" and opened doors for regular faith discussions.

**Mentorship and Education:** As Head of Animation at Lipscomb University and author of respected animation textbooks, Tom trains the next generation of animators with both technical excellence and faith integration.

**Creative Integrity Under Pressure:** During *Light of the World* production, Tom experienced the rare blessing of a faith-driven producer who prioritized telling Jesus's story authentically over commercial considerations. "There were times I was up at night praying and going are we doing the right thing?"

**Supernatural Provision:** Tom's leap of faith to Franklin in 2003 - risking location independence before widespread internet - has resulted in 20+ years of thriving business, proving God's provision for obedient steps.

**Industry Influence:** Through his podcast, #MerMay Instagram movement, and speaking engagements, Tom influences the animation industry toward higher standards and faith integration, demonstrating that Christians can lead rather than follow in creative fields.

**Artistic Worship:** Tom approaches character design as spiritual work, especially when drawing Jesus: "I'm putting a lot of me into Jesus as I'm drawing him. I'm thinking of him as a person and going how would he lovingly look at me." He believes an artist's hand "can never be copied or duplicated" because of the "love level" and passion invested.

**Bold Faith Declaration:** Tom has learned that "anytime you speak truth... it doesn't fall on false ears," leading to increased boldness in sharing faith through his platform and work.

## Core Principles & Legacy

**Excellence as Witness:** Tom proves that Christians can compete at the highest levels of secular entertainment while maintaining faith integrity. His Disney credentials lend credibility to faith-based projects.

**Strategic Positioning:** Rather than abandoning mainstream entertainment, Tom strategically engages both secular and Christian markets, bringing kingdom values to all his work.

**Generational Impact:** Through *Light of the World* and other projects, Tom creates content that could shape how "generations of kids could potentially be thinking about our version of Jesus when they read the Bible."

**Courage Over Comfort:** Tom's willingness to leave financial security for faith obedience demonstrates that God honors those who put His kingdom first.

**Artistic Calling:** Tom models how creative gifts are meant to serve God's purposes, not just personal success or cultural acceptance.
