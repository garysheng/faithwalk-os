**Background:** Co-founder of DivX, Meta-crisis theorist, Game B movement participant  

## What Motivated His Devotion to Christ

Jordan Hall's arc toward Christianity evolved over the past few years, marked by a thoughtful shift from a secular, systems-oriented worldview to open religious commitment as a Christian. Formerly identifying as a tech pioneer, philosopher, and key figure in the Game B and "meta-crisis" discourse, Hall underwent a significant personal transformation that he publicly described as "shocking" even to himself, given his previous skepticism about religion.

His journey began not from cultural conditioning but through rigorous philosophical inquiry and mystical experience. After business failures left his family "quasi-homeless," they landed in Black Mountain, NC, where he was invited to a simple country church in Swannanoa. There he had what he describes as a "psychedelic" realization: "Holy shit, that's the thing. This is actually the thing in the right order."

What followed was an intensive research period to reconcile intellectual integrity with faith, during which he discovered his profound ignorance about core Christian concepts (faith, Trinity, crucifixion). His conversion wasn't based on cultural inheritance but on genuine seeking that led to finding.

## How He's Thriving While Keeping God First

**Professional Background:**
- Co-founded DivX, revolutionizing online digital video
- Early employee at MP3.com, helping shape digital music distribution
- Raised over $150M for DivX, led $600M IPO
- Angel investor and technologist post-exit
- Key voice in "Game B" movement (alternative civilization models)
- Meta-crisis theorist and complex systems thinker

- Experiences divine guidance in practical interactions
- Wife is pregnant, part of thriving family-oriented community
- Applies complex systems thinking to Christian theology and practice

**Revolutionary Theological Framework:**
Hall has developed sophisticated models integrating network theory with Christian practice:

- **Network Topology Applications**: Maps the three fundamental network topologies (centralized, decentralized, distributed) onto Christian denominations - Catholics as primarily centralized (Petrine), Orthodox as decentralized (apostolic), and Protestants as distributed (Pentecostal)

- **The Three Tyrannies of Modernity**: Identifies chronological tyranny (Kronos time), propositional tyranny (abstract facts over lived experience), and third-person tyranny (dissociation from presence) as fundamentally "antichrist"

- **Faith Redefined**: "When I say faith I do not mean maximally unevidenced belief... That is a defamation. That is in fact a lie... Faith is the boundary between the unconscious and the conscious threshold when properly ordered."

## Core Teachings & Insights

**On the Meta-Crisis:**
> "Categorically the heart of the metacrisis is in fact a religious crisis... you keep going down the stack when you get to the bottom of the stack you're like oh that's actually where it is."

**On Faith vs. Reason:**
> "Religion is not where you ask the deepest questions. It's where you participate in the deepest life, which is a deeper place than asking questions."

**On Divine Guidance:**
> "Learn how to listen to God and do what he tells you to do... this is a categorical solution to the complexity of the meta crisis... you need infinity. But infinity is online. He wants to talk to you."

**On Game B and Christianity (2025):**
> "Game B is just a very nerdy way of trying to get to Christianity. Game A is what we might call this world and game B is the kingdom."

**On Spiritual Warfare as Reality:**
> "Everything matters. Every choice you make, every action you take, every breath, every word is ultimately laden with consequence. It's either towards God or away from God. There is no neutral and there is no irrelevant."

**On the AI Crisis:**
> "You will be consumed body mind and soul by AI if you are not able to cleave utterly to Christ... There is very little choice left but to fully commit yourself to discipleship."

## Theological Perspectives

**Participatory vs. Propositional Truth:**
Hall emphasizes living faith over abstract doctrine, focusing on agapic love with both horizontal (community) and vertical (divine) dimensions. He critiques the church's "propositional tyranny" and advocates for "open and convicting" rather than "open and affirming."

**The Divine Economy Vision:**
Hall envisions a post-crisis culture where people "take their orders from God" rather than operating strategically. This approach represents the practical embodiment of authentic Christian community scaled up.

**Educational Revolution:**
He argues education must return entirely to the church as holistic formation in communion, outlining three developmental stages (0-7: embodiment, 7-14: community formation, 14-21: vocational calling) all centered on cultivating "whole humans in right relationship with God."

**Anti-Strategic Approach:**
Hall completely rejects strategic approaches to evangelism or cultural change, advocating only authentic witness and obedience to divine guidance: "There is no selling. Okay. Um there is only telling the truth as best you can... showing up are you try to show up as you are called by God."

## Recent Developments (2025)

**Fifth Generation Warfare Theory:**
Hall connects modern warfare evolution to spiritual reality, arguing that as warfare has become more sophisticated, it has become "isomorphic with spiritual warfare." The enemy operates through confusion about values and meaning rather than direct violence.

**Generational Analysis:**
He identifies Gen X as the "Moses generation" who can see the promised land but won't enter it, while Millennials/Gen Z are the "Joshua generation" called to cross over through spiritual warfare.

**Forest Landry Collaboration:**
Ongoing deep engagement with philosopher Forest Landry on Immanent Domain Metaphysics and its applications to understanding the Trinity, representing cutting-edge work on transcendent logic and participatory knowing.

**Church as Total Institution:**
Hall envisions churches recovering their medieval role as governors of the commons, providing housing, economic context, and education for members in a "profound revival."

## Legacy & Learn More

Jordan Hall represents a unique case study in authentic intellectual conversionâ€”approaching Christianity through rigorous philosophical inquiry rather than cultural conditioning. His combination of tech entrepreneurship, meta-crisis thinking, and genuine Christian faith makes him a distinctive voice for addressing the spiritual dimensions of civilizational challenges.

**Key Contributions:**
1. **Intellectual Integration** - Demonstrates serious engagement with Christianity leading to genuine conversion
2. **Systems Theology** - Applies complex systems thinking to Christian practice and community
3. **Cultural Bridge** - Credibility with both secular intellectuals and religious communities
4. **Anti-Strategic Witness** - Models authentic faith over strategic evangelism
5. **Prophetic Voice** - Understanding digital-age challenges through Christian lens

**Lasting Lesson:** The meta-crisis is fundamentally a religious crisis requiring spiritual rather than technical solutions. Hall's emphasis on "participatory truth" over "propositional truth" offers a pathway for authentic Christian community in a fragmented world.

*"We are reaching post literacy... A new image will emerge... We're working at something that is going to be much more like the medieval mind than it is like the modern mind."*

**Current Focus:** Living out Christian discipleship in rural North Carolina, raising family in faith-centered community, developing practical applications of divine guidance, and bridging Game B community with authentic Christianity.
