# The Book of You

***A spoken word piece about stepping into your apostolic calling and living a life worthy of testimony***

What if I told you
God wants to write another book?

Not a new revelation—
The Bible is complete,
The canon is closed,
The Word is finished.

But your LIFE?
Your life could be another testament
To His glory.

The Book of Matthew,
The Book of Mark,
The Book of Luke,
The Book of John—
What about The Book of YOU?

God didn't play favorites back then,
He doesn't play favorites now.
Every apostle in Scripture
Was just a regular person
Who said "Yes" to an extraordinary calling.

And that calling?
It never ended.

"Go and make disciples of all nations"—
That wasn't just for the twelve,
That was for ALL of us.
Every believer is called to be an apostle,
Every Christian is commissioned
To cast out demons,
To heal the sick,
To be a light in the darkness.

But here's the thing:
Many are called,
Very few accept the call.

Most of us are writing boring books—
The Book of Playing It Safe,
The Book of Blending In,
The Book of Sunday-Only Churchianity.

But God is looking for people
Whose lives are so radical,
So filled with His power,
So undeniably miraculous
That people can't help but notice.

He's looking for modern-day apostles
Who step into the authority
They were granted the day they were saved.

Your children?
Each one could be an apostle
With the power to transform nations.
That's why He calls us to be fruitful and multiply—
Every child is a potential world-changer,
A potential book of testimony.

So ask yourself:
What acts are you carrying out
That remind people of God's glory?
Are you stepping into your role
As one who spreads the good news?
Are you opening minds and hearts?
Are you claiming the authority
Christ gave you when you were saved?

Or are you living so small,
So quiet,
So "normal"
That when you die,
There's nothing on those pages
Of the Book of You.

The world is waiting
For your Book,
Not for your fame,
Not for your glory,
But as a reminder
That we can still be apostles,
That miracles still happen,
That God is still moving
Through ordinary people
Who dare to live extraordinary lives.

The question isn't
Whether you're called—
You ARE called.

The question is:
Will you accept?

Will you live in such a way
That your life becomes
A testament to His power,
A chapter in His ongoing story,
A book that points people
Back to the Author of all books?

Your voice carries the power
That spoke the world into existence.
The words are waiting on your tongue.
God is listening to hear
What The Book of You will declare.
