# **Why America Feels Like Hell**

### ***When you wake up as an awakened follower of Christ, and you start to love what Christ loves, and hate what Christ hates, you realize that the United States has become the 'world' incarnate—a living monument to disobedience of God***

I used to think America was basically good. Flawed but redeemable. A Christian nation that had lost its way but could find it again with the right leaders and policies.

I was wrong.

**America does not serve God. America serves Mammon.**

We've built a civilization that worships money, power, and what we call "freedom"—which has become the freedom to be degenerate, to cause societal decay, to destroy the sources of truth and life.

The more freedom we get, the more we destroy Christ. That's why our birthrate is catastrophic. That's why our most famous people are liars and charlatans. That's why you can barely name five real saints on one hand unless you go out of your way to find them.

Notice: no one asks for more rights to be constrained. No one asks for more freedom to walk the narrow path. Our worship of money and freedom has brought us straight to hell.

What we should worship is Christ—not freedom, not equality, not love as abstract concepts. When you worship equality, you get communism. When you worship love, you get the LGBT movement. All these words get twisted by the enemy. There's only one narrow path: Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life. Understanding what that means takes a lifetime, and I'm still grappling with even a fraction of it.

"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge." — Hosea 4:6

This shows how upside down we've become. As Paul warned: "They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator" (Romans 1:25).

When you embrace what Christ actually wants—turning away from the world—you see America clearly. We are not in God's favor. We're a country where billions of Bibles have been printed throughout our history, yet we've chosen systematic disobedience anyway.

That's the worst kind of rebellion. The people who deserve the lowest realms of hell are those who knew the truth and picked a different route.

## **The Syndicate of Satan Controls America**

Satan must be proud of his successful military coup of America. The devil has his grips in America precisely because Americans have so much potential to be saved and help save others—Satan always attacks what threatens him most.

What does it look like to live in a captured nation?

It's almost impossible to live and participate in American society without constantly sinning. The infrastructure of American life is designed to make you fall. *[See: Recognize and Resist Sinfrastructure](../principles/recognize-and-resist-sinfrastructure.md) for understanding how these systems are engineered to promote sin.*

Our phones activate lust on demand. Our apps turn us into gambling addicts. Our entertainment celebrates what God calls abomination. Our leaders fund wars while trafficking children. Our economy profits from human weakness.

This isn't accidental. This is systematic.

We've created a system where virtue requires superhuman effort while vice flows downhill. Where following Christ means swimming against every current of normal life. Where speaking truth costs you access, income, and relationships.

## **The Presidents Tell the Story**

Look at our presidents. They represent what we actually value, not what we claim to value.

We elect liars and child predators who start abominable wars to enrich arms dealers and their investors. We celebrate them as they take God's name in vain while advancing anti-Christian policies around the world.

Who we elect as leaders is a reflection of generations of spiritual warfare that might just be a preview of the end times. A nation that repeatedly chooses leaders who mock God (while claiming divine blessing) is a nation that deserves harsh judgment.

The supposed fight between libertarianism and socialists/communists is largely different flavors of secular materialism—false lights distracting us from the real issue. *[See: Don't Advance Anti-Christian Causes](../principles/dont-advance-anti-christian-causes.md) for discerning these competing ideologies that ultimately lead away from Christ.* While some principles like liberty under law have allowed Christianity to flourish here more than in oppressive regimes, all this culture war noise is just rearranging chairs on the Titanic while people avoid acknowledging that Christ's Way is extremely narrow and extremely difficult to follow.

A democratic socialist is no worse than an unrepentant, corrupt, money-loving "Christian" leader. Libertarianism has no soul and no answer to the moral questions that actually matter. Socialism and communism are hyper-materialistic, obsessed with money and power like everything else.

These secular ideologies presented as our only options aren't even on the table for Christians who want to stay focused on what they should actually be doing in the world.

The deeper issue is that we've made idols out of everything except Christ. *[See: Reserve the Pedestal for God](../principles/reserve-the-pedestal-for-god.md) for understanding how modern culture systematically creates false worship.*

## **Our Lust Is Insatiable**

Americans have an insatiable lust for materialism, status, and power. We measure success by wealth accumulation and social media followers. Even American Christian faith is measured by material wealth—more money equals "God loves me more." We worship celebrities who are spiritually bankrupt. We build entire industries around human trafficking disguised as entertainment.

Through revelations about the Epstein network, it's clear that America deems child rape as presidential.

In America, you can get away with anything if you have enough money or power—our legal and electoral systems are designed to protect the wealthy while crushing the poor. Justice is for sale to the highest bidder.

And look at our schools—a complete joke that produces graduates who can't think, can't build, and can't discern truth from lies.

Our birthrate is catastrophic with no quick fixes, so techno-utopians like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel propose artificial wombs and AI girlfriends as solutions while constructing a total surveillance state that will enforce total control on all money.

The biopharma complex is already positioning itself to profit from the mass meaning crisis, offering chemical Band-aids for spiritual emptiness instead of pointing people to Christ.

We worship the wrong people—tech oligarchs and financial elites who've gathered unprecedented power and are building a mass surveillance state unlike anything we've ever seen. Their lust for control is as insatiable as their lust for money and power.

Their appetite for more is never satisfied because they're trying to fill a God-shaped hole with God-rejecting substitutes. The result is a culture of perpetual emptiness that tries to solve its emptiness with more of what caused it.

## **There Are No Quick Fixes**

I'm not writing this to offer solutions because there aren't any quick fixes for this level of societal degeneration. We're looking at a multi-decade dark age, if not complete collapse.

When a country this blessed chooses systematic rebellion against God, the consequences are civilizational. You can't policy your way out of spiritual death. You can't vote your way back to righteousness when the entire system profits from sin.

That said, I have written about how Christians can create strongholds within a fallen country in my piece on building [Christofuturist towns](https://substack.garysheng.com/p/refounding). But even then, it is multi-decade long project to create a new center of gravity for obedient Christians.

Some ask: "Is it time to leave America? Where do you escape to?"

The hard truth is that Satan's influence is pervasive across the earth. Other countries have their own spiritual darkness.

There is no physical escape. Wherever you go, there you are. You either walk in truth—Jesus Christ as truth incarnate—or you keep falling into sin and despair no matter what passport you hold.

I'm in the middle of killing my old self right now, and it's brutally difficult. It means leaving behind almost all of your friends. Saying no to almost every invite and job opportunity because they're not the calling God has for you.

The narrow path is narrow as can be.

## **What This Means for American Christians**

Take America off your pedestal. Stop trying to make it great when it has repeatedly chosen rebellion over righteousness.

Yes, America has had moments of grace—the abolition movement, Great Awakenings that birthed hospitals and schools, billions of Bibles spreading the Gospel worldwide. But just ask the descendants of African slaves about the systematic destruction of their families after emancipation. God has used flawed nations before, but that doesn't excuse our ongoing disobedience.

Stop confusing patriotism with Christianity.

**Put Christ first and foremost.** Put all your attention toward Him if you've turned away or deprioritized Him.

**Disentangle from corrupting systems.** *[See: Sever Your Ties With Modern Culture](../principles/sever-your-ties-with-modern-culture.md) for practical steps to separate from the cultural systems that make sin feel natural and righteousness feel heroic.*

(This is advice to myself as much as anyone!)

It may not be America's destiny to be redeemed. That's a project that would require mass repentance. But our God is the God of miracles...

Pray for America's leaders and lost souls—God desires all to be saved (1 Timothy 2:1-4).

America has chosen its god—and it's not the God of the Bible.

The good thing is that your job isn't to save America. Your job is to follow Christ and be salt and light (Matthew 5:13-16)—even if, especially if, your country has chosen hell.

*"No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money." — Matthew 6:24*
