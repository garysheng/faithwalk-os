# The Tithe and Offering Prayer

---

Father, I thank You and praise You  
for translating me from the kingdom of darkness  
into the kingdom that You have prepared for me.

Thank You that it is a kingdom of joy,  
a kingdom of mercy,  
a kingdom of peace,  
and a kingdom of abundance.

I bring my tithe now to You, Lord Jesus.  
It is the first fruit of what You have given me,  
and I plant it in Your kingdom as a seed of blessings.

Expecting the rich blessings of heaven  
to be multiplied to me in return.

I thank you Lord that you rebuke the devourer for my sake  
and I stand in agreement with your word  
that he will not destroy my land.

He will not destroy my blessings  
and he will not destroy my crops in the field.

I am a citizen of your kingdom.  
I have the rights and privileges  
of a citizen of that kingdom  
and I stand in and upon them.

Thank you Jesus.  
Heaven's unlimited resources are mine,  
and I receive them as mine.

All my needs, according to your riches in glory,  
I receive the Lord as my shepherd,  
and I shall not want.

In your name, Jesus.  

**Amen.**

*"Will a man rob God? Yet you have robbed Me! But you say, 'In what way have we robbed You?' In tithes and offerings. You are cursed with a curse, for you have robbed Me, even this whole nation. Bring all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be food in My house, and try Me now in this,' says the Lord of hosts, 'If I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you such blessing that there will not be room enough to receive it.'" â€” Malachi 3:8-10*
