# Childlike Faith

***A spoken word piece about what happens when you give all of yourself to the creator of the ultimate cosmic adventure we're living***

We are SO lucky—
Like, do you even realize what's happening here?

We're players in the most immersive video game of all time,
We're characters in the greatest story ever told—
And we GET to be in it!

This isn't some boring simulation,
This isn't some random accident,
This is THE ultimate experience designed by the Creator of the universe
And He said "You know what? I want YOU in my game."

Think about it—
We're tiny little creatures on this spinning rock
Flying through space at thousands of miles per hour
In a galaxy with billions of stars
In a universe so vast our minds can't even grasp it—
And the God who MADE all of that
Knows your name,
Counts your hairs,
Cares about your Tuesday afternoon!

That's INSANE!
That's beautiful!
That's the kind of love that makes you want to dance in the grocery store!
*Trader Joe's by the way...*

And here's the plot twist—
Evil thinks it's winning,
There's drama everywhere,
The suspense is REAL,
But God already wrote the ending
And spoiler alert: HE wins, and WE win!

But you gotta have faith like a little kid—
That wide-eyed, "WHOA!" kind of faith
Where everything is possible
And your Dad is the strongest man in the world
Except in this case, your Father literally IS the strongest force in all existence!

When you're five years old and your dad says "I got you,"
You don't worry about the mortgage,
You don't stress about the stock market,
You just know Dad's got it handled—
That's the faith that moves mountains!

God's been having your back since before you were born,
He's been orchestrating plot twists to work out for your good,
He's been setting up divine appointments,
Opening doors you didn't even know existed,
Closing doors that would have led you somewhere you don't want to go—

And all He asks is:
"Do you trust me?
Do you love me like I love you?
Do you believe I'm good?"

Because if you do—
If you really, truly, childlike-wonder DO—
Your life is about to be FREAKING AWESOME.
As it was designed to be.

Not easy—awesome.
Not without challenges—but with a God who turns challenges into comebacks.
Not without tears—but with a Father who collects every one.

This is the game where the faithful underdog always wins,
Where the meek inherit the earth,
Where the last become first,
Where love conquers all—
And you're not just watching from the sidelines,
You're one of the game's main characters!

And here's the beautiful part—
When you help other people realize THEY'RE main characters too,
When you wake them up to their cosmic significance,
When you help them see they were designed for greatness, for godliness...
THAT'S when the joy multiplies!

Because this isn't a zero-sum game,
This isn't "only one person gets to be the hero,"
This is "EVERYONE gets to be the hero of their own story
While playing supporting roles in everyone else's!"

Love our Father with all your heart, soul, and mind,
and love the other characters like you're loving yourself!

God didn't create extras,
He didn't make background characters,
Every single person you meet
Was designed to be cosmically significant!
They just forgot it.
But it's easy to remember, with your help.

So wake up tomorrow with that five-year-old excitement
That excitement I had when I opened up a new pack of Pokemon cards
Or was able to play Mario Kart with my brother Tony for the first time
Wake up with excitement today and ask
"What adventure does Dad have planned for me today?"
"What impossible thing is about to become possible?"
"How is He going to blow my mind once again this time?"

Because when you have THAT kind of faith—
The kind that makes you grateful just to be alive,
The kind that sees miracles in Monday mornings,
The kind that trusts when it doesn't make sense—
That's when life becomes the epic adventure it was always meant to be.

We get to play the ultimate game
With the ultimate Father
Who makes it amazingly interesting at every turn
And who already guaranteed us the ultimate victory.

What else could you possibly ask for?
