# Principles

These documents capture my practical frameworks for walking the narrow path. Each principle is designed to be legible, critiquable, and forkable.

## How to Use
- Start with identity and posture, then move to environment and practice
- Follow cross-links; many principles reinforce each other
- Apply the Recognition and Practice questions at the end of each file

## Suggested Starting Path
1. [Eat From the Tree of Life, Not Knowledge](eat-from-the-tree-of-life-not-knowledge.md)
2. [Sever Your Ties With Modern Culture](sever-your-ties-with-modern-culture.md)
3. [Recognize and Resist Sinfrastructure](recognize-and-resist-sinfrastructure.md)
4. [Listen to Heavenly Music](listen-to-heavenly-music.md)
5. [Reserve the Pedestal for God](reserve-the-pedestal-for-god.md)
6. [Study Wise Spiritual Elders](study-wise-spiritual-elders.md)
7. [Appreciate Each Denominationâ€™s Gifts](appreciate-each-denominations-gifts.md)

## Contributing / Forking
- One principle per file; use kebab-case filenames
- Include: brief thesis, core argument, Scripture anchors, Recognition and Practice
- Add cross-links to related principles and to the Executive Summary: ../christian-ontology_executive-summary.md
