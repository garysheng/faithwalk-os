# Apostle Delmar Coward Jr.

**Location:** Raywood, Texas  
**Ministry:** Encounter (TVMI) Ministry  
**Focus:** Recompense Theology, Divine Healing, Radical Faith

## What Motivated His Devotion to Christ

Apostle Delmar Coward Jr. leads with the authority of someone who has experienced God's supernatural intervention firsthand. His ministry is built on the foundation of "recompense" - God's promise to compensate His people for everything the devil has stolen. This isn't theoretical theology for Coward; it's lived reality proven through miraculous healings, deliverances, and supernatural provision.

His approach to faith was crystallized during his own battle with COVID-19, when three doctors declared he would die. Rather than accepting this verdict, Coward demonstrated the power of spoken faith: "The power of life and death is not in the virus. It's in my mouth. So I said to that coronavirus, guess what? You will die. You would die now." Three days later, the virus was not only dead but gone without a trace.

This victory over death established his uncompromising stance: "There's no sickness on this earth that can take you out unless you agree with it."

## How He's Thriving While Keeping God First

**Radical Faith Declarations:** Coward operates in absolute faith with no room for religious limitation. His ministry demonstrates that miracles aren't rare exceptions but the normal Christian experience. "No more religion. No more religion. That's weak. It's time to have what God said."

**Documented Miraculous Healings:**
- Prayed for Austin, an autistic child who went from making 20s in school to 90s after deliverance
- Cast out the spirit of Down syndrome from a young man who was transformed overnight
- Laid hands on a woman dying from AIDS who was completely healed within two weeks

**Spiritual Warfare Authority:** His ministry demonstrates practical spiritual warfare. During one encounter, a demon-possessed man couldn't see through the blood of Jesus that Coward had pleaded over another person: "He said, there's blood on that man... And it was the blood of Jesus that I plead over that man that he couldn't even see through."

**Prison Ministry Impact:** When Encounter ministry enters maximum security prisons, supernatural transformation follows. "When we were coming into the prison, everybody was on good behavior... There ain't no cutting, no shanking... because they want to come to the meeting." Even broken fans begin working supernaturally during their services.

**Prosperity as Divine Right:** Coward teaches that God desires His children to prosper: "My God is going to make me rich... I don't care if the money comes through a pain, through a train, or through a crane. It's coming. Why? Because God said so." This isn't greed but understanding divine inheritance.

**Faith Mechanics:** He emphasizes the power of spoken words to activate faith: "Your mouth activates your faith... It takes words to activate your faith... Everything happens because of a word that's spoken."

**Practical Spiritual Protection:** Provides red mantles for protection, declaring: "God told me that something crazy was going to happen, some diseases, some things are going to happen. And if you put that mantle above your doorpost, then no devil will be able to come in."

## Core Teachings & Declarations

**The Recompense Message:** Based on Hebrews 10:30 and Proverbs 11:31, Coward teaches that God's justice system includes divine compensation for all injustice and suffering. "Recompense means everybody say pay day... to compensate, to repay, to make imminent... I'm not talking about when you get to heaven. I'm talking about God. I want you to have it right here."

**Kingdom Identity Declaration:** Services conclude with believers declaring: "I am Kingdom. I know the word. I believe the word. I speak the word and I receive the word. I know who I am. I am a child of God. I am Kingdom."

**Faith Activation Prayers:** Coward leads believers in specific declarations for breakthrough, healing, and divine compensation, teaching them to "make the devil pay the damages."

3. **Divine Justice Focus** - God as active recompenser of injustice
4. **Healing as Normal** - Miracles as expected Christian experience
5. **Prosperity as Inheritance** - Material blessing as divine right
