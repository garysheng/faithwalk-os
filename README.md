# Welcome to Gary's 'Faith Walk OS'

Faith Walk OS is a systematic documentation of my (Gary Sheng's) personal worldview and framework for following Christ. The idea is that my complete approach to faith and walking the narrow path should be legible, critiquable, and forkable.

## Why Document Your Christian Worldview?

It's so easy in this world to fall into a life of sin. There are so many bullet trains to hell, so many worldly ways to slide into sin. The more intentional you are about your Christian worldview and your walk, the easier it is for you to design your life in a way that leads more consistently to righteousness.

Most Christians drift spiritually because they've never forced themselves to crystallize their theology, their approach to discernment, their framework for making decisions. Without intentional documentation and accountability, we lose clarity about what we actually believe and how to live it out.

**Version controlling your walk with Christ makes sense!** GitHub make it easy for that walk to be:
- Queryable by AI
- Updatable as you grow  
- Transparent to others who want to quickly assess their spiritual alignment with you

An open-source approach to worldview development creates accountability for yourself—helping you stay on the narrow path—and enables others to benefit from what works. If you figure out something that actually leads to righteousness, it should be forkable so others can adapt it to their own walk.

## Getting Started

The patterns you see, the discernment you've developed, the frameworks that guide your decisions—none of this helps the body of Christ if it stays locked in your head.

Your forkable worldview and walk might be exactly what someone needs to dive deeper into the faith.
