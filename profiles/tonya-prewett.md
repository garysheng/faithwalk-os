# Tonya Prewett ("Mama Prew")

**Location:** Auburn, Alabama  
**Ministry:** Unite US Revival Movement  
**Focus:** College Campus Revival, Student Discipleship, National Awakening

## What Motivated Her Devotion to Christ

Tonya Prewett's devotion to Christ was ignited through her experiences mentoring college students struggling with pain, anxiety, and depression. As she encountered the depth of their struggles, her heart was moved to prayer and spiritual action. The turning point came during her daily campus prayer walks at Auburn University, where God gave her a vision of thousands of students worshipping together for revival and freedom.

"I received a vision from God to see thousands of students worshipping together for revival and freedom," Tonya recalls. This divine encounter prompted her to gather local leaders and churches to bring the vision to life. Her persistent prayer walks became the foundation of what would grow into a national movement, demonstrating how God uses a mother's heart and faithful intercession to birth revival.

## How She's Thriving While Keeping God First

**Prayer-Saturated Leadership:** Tonya and the Unite team consistently credit their thriving not to personal ability, but to "the hand of God" and a lifestyle saturated with prayer, obedience, and partnership with local churches. Each Unite event is built on intensive prayer and collaboration with local ministries.

**Humble Stewardship:** Despite leading a movement that has grown from a handful of volunteers to drawing thousands of students across the country, Tonya maintains humility and intentional focus on God's guidance. She consistently directs glory to Christ rather than herself, understanding her role as a vessel for God's purposes.

**Vision to Reality:** What began as a vision during prayer walks has manifested into Unite US - a national revival movement bringing college students together in worship and devotion to Christ. The movement emphasizes salvation, freedom, and community, with each gathering designed to create encounters with God's presence.

**Family Integration:** As the wife of Auburn basketball coach Chad Prewett and mother of author Madison Prewett Troutt, Tonya demonstrates how to pursue God's calling while honoring family relationships. Her family connections have provided platforms and credibility for the ministry's expansion.

**Campus Transformation:** Unite events create environments where students experience genuine spiritual breakthrough, freedom from bondage, and authentic community. The movement focuses on meeting students where they are and providing ongoing discipleship through local church partnerships.

**Supernatural Provision:** The rapid growth from local vision to national movement demonstrates God's supernatural provision and favor. Tonya's obedience to the initial vision has opened doors across college campuses nationwide, with each event building momentum for the next.
