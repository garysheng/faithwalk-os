# Make Satan Struggle

*You as a Christian are not called to be passive in the face of evil—you're called to make Satan's work as difficult as possible.*

We live in an upside-down world where evil has made itself comfortable, where corruption flows freely through institutions, and where speaking truth comes at tremendous personal cost. *[See: Why America Feels Like Hell](../perspectives/why-america-feels-like-hell.md) for understanding how systemic this corruption has become.*

But that's precisely when followers of Christ are called to stand up and make the enemy struggle for every inch of ground.

Expect to encounter Satan's influence as you advance to higher places in the world. As Scripture teaches, "our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (Ephesians 6:12).

If you plan to fiercely follow Christ's Way, the question isn't whether you'll face evil—it's whether you'll make Satan struggle when you face him.

## The Cost of Confronting Evil

Evil works by making resistance seem impossible, especially if you have family responsibilities or material concerns to protect. If you believe in a purely materialistic universe with no afterlife, it becomes rational to cower to corruption rather than sacrifice everything for truth.

But I've witnessed modern saints who chose the harder path.

- **Lieutenant Colonel Tony Aguilar**, a 25-year Green Beret veteran, sacrificed his comfortable retirement to expose war crimes in Gaza. He went from making breakfast for his family and walking his dog to becoming a target for telling the truth about systematic civilian targeting and fraudulent humanitarian operations.

- **Pastor Ara Torosian** built an underground church network of 7,500 people across four Iranian cities, was tortured for three days for smuggling Bibles, and now faces persecution again as Iranian Christians are detained by ICE in America. He could have stayed quiet, kept his head down, but instead chose to be a voice for the oppressed.

- **Tiffany Cianci** fights private equity firms that weaponized courts to force her to have an abortion, sued her in five jurisdictions simultaneously, and cost her over $130,000 in legal fees—all because she refused to let them exploit small business owners and special needs children without a fight.

These people made Satan struggle. They forced evil to expend enormous resources trying to silence them, and in doing so, exposed the corruption for others to see.

## The Passivity Trap

Most Christians have been taught that being Christ-like means being passive. But "turn the other cheek" forbids personal vengeance, not courageous resistance to evil (Matthew 5:38–42; Romans 12:17–21). Jesus wasn't passive when He overturned the money changers' tables (John 2:13–17). He wasn't passive when He called out the Pharisees as "whitewashed tombs."

**Christian resistance is truthful, courageous, and non-vengeful (1 Peter 5:8–9).**

Satan wants you to see passivity as virtuous because passive Christians don't threaten his operations. You can sing worship songs, attend Bible studies, and tithe regularly without ever disrupting a single demonic system. Comfortable Christianity serves Satan's purposes perfectly. *[See: Don't Be A Churchian](dont-be-a-churchian.md) for understanding how religious performance can mask spiritual passivity.*

But when you start living in truth—really living it, not just believing it—you become a threat. When you refuse to participate in corrupt systems, call out lies, and choose integrity over convenience, you force the enemy to work harder to maintain his control.

## My Experience With Compromise

I don't feel like I've actually done much to confront evil directly.

Though, what I have done is leave environments that feel satanic or borderline satanic. I've walked away from business partners who aren't living in truth. I encourage friends not to compromise, but I have a long way to go.

I still have a big part of me that I need to kill that would like being around famous and powerful people, even if they're not on the side of Christ. That's something I need to work on.

But I'm doing my best not to support the halls of evil, even subtly, through my purchases and activities. For example, I have been to strip clubs in the past and have had my party days, but I now understand that aspects of nightlife culture are often entangled with sex trafficking networks—patterns investigations have documented. 

I refuse to implicitly perpetuate such systems.

I refuse to buy products from companies owned by evil private equity firms like the one that has gone after Tiffany.

I refuse to build or support friends building sinfrastructure. *[See: Recognize and Resist Sinfrastructure](recognize-and-resist-sinfrastructure.md) for understanding these systems designed to make sin easier.*

These are tangible ways to resist evil, even if you don't end up devoting your life to activism.

Even small acts of non-compliance make Satan struggle.


## Making Evil Work Harder

**Refuse to participate in corrupt systems.** Don't just complain about evil—stop feeding it with your time, money, and energy. Make Satan find other people to do his work. *[See: Work With Righteous People](work-with-righteous-people.md) for building your own platform of independence from corrupt systems.*

**Speak truth even if it costs you.** When you see corruption, call it out. When you witness injustice, document it. When you encounter lies, expose them. Force the enemy to expend resources silencing you.

**Support those who are already fighting.** People like Tony Aguilar, Pastor Ara, and Tiffany Cianci need backing—financial, spiritual, and practical support. Make their resistance sustainable.

**Build alternative infrastructure.** Don't just resist evil systems—create righteous alternatives (if you can). Every platform, organization, and community built on kingdom principles makes Satan's dominance less complete.

**Choose integrity over security.** The enemy's greatest weapon is making you believe you can't afford to do what's right. But you can't afford not to—your soul and the souls of those watching you are at stake.

## Reflection and Practice

**Ask yourself as you encounter evil and corruption:**

1. **Am I making Satan's work easier or harder through my choices?**
2. **Do I prioritize my security over God's truth when they conflict?**
3. **Am I supporting people who courageously confront evil?**
4. **Would I rather be comfortable and complicit or costly and clean?**

You weren't called to be passive in the face of evil. You were called to be salt and light in a corrupt world. Salt preserves and light exposes—both are active, not passive.

Make Satan struggle for every victory. Force evil to work harder. Choose truth even when it costs you everything. The enemy's greatest fear is Christians who refuse to be comfortable with compromise.

*"Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." — James 4:7*
