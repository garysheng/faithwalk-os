# The War on You

***A spoken word piece about the invisible war on your identity and the one way to fight back***

What's happening to you?

AIs,
TV shows,
Porn sites,
Therapists,
Dating apps,
Internet gurus,
Three letter agencies,
And of course...
Foreign governments.

Collectively, they're attacking
Your identity,
Your worldview,
Your purpose,
Your attention,
Your relationships,
Your body,
Your mind,
Your conscience,
Your wonder,
Your faith in yourself and the future.

Have these people, organizations, and algorithms
Been hijacked by the devil?
Or are they acting on their own?

Ultimately, it doesn't matter.

Whether Satan has tinkered with them or not,
They're all leading you away from the one thing
That will save your soul.

The opposing army is stacked.
But you can fight them,
And win the war.

There's one way to do it.

His Way.

The Way that reminds you that
You're not a victim,
You're not a consumer,
You're not a product to be sold.

You are a child of the Most High God.

And when you walk in that Truth,
When you live from that identity,
When you fight from that position—
The war is already won.
