# The Lord's Prayer

---

***The prayer that Jesus taught His disciples, as recorded in Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4.***

Our Father who art in heaven,  
hallowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come,  
thy will be done  
on earth as it is in heaven.

Give us this day our daily bread,  
and forgive us our trespasses,  
as we forgive those who trespass against us.

And lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from evil.

For thine is the kingdom,  
and the power,  
and the glory,  
forever.

**Amen.**

*"And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray then like this..." â€” Matthew 6:7-9*
