# The Abraham Pattern

God often reveals His plans step-by-step rather than all at once. He calls people to take a first step in faith, only showing the next phase as they obey.

## Biblical Example: Abraham

**Step 1 - The Initial Call:** God told Abraham "Go from your country, your people and your father's household to the land I will show you" *(Genesis 12:1)*. Notice God didn't say "Go to Canaan" or give him a map. Abraham had to leave everything familiar with only a vague promise of "a land I will show you."

**Step 2 - Basic Promise Given:** Only after Abraham obeyed and left Haran did God reveal the next layer: "To your offspring I will give this land" *(Genesis 12:7)*. Abraham still didn't know how this would happen—he was 75 and childless.

**Step 3 - Covenant Details Emerge:** Years later, after more obedience through various tests, God expanded the promise: descendants as numerous as stars, specific land boundaries, and the covenant ritual *(Genesis 15)*. But Abraham still waited 25 more years for Isaac.

**Step 4 - The Ultimate Test:** Only after decades of faithful walking did God reveal the final test—sacrifice Isaac *(Genesis 22)*. Abraham had learned to trust God's character so deeply that he believed God would provide, even if it meant resurrection *(Hebrews 11:19)*.

**Abraham's journey: initial vague call → basic promise after obedience → expanded details through continued faithfulness → ultimate purpose revealed through deepest test.**

## Another Biblical Example: Moses at the Red Sea

**Step 1 - Impossible Situation:** The Israelites were trapped between Pharaoh's army and the Red Sea. God didn't immediately explain His rescue plan or split the waters in advance. Instead, He told Moses "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to move forward" *(Exodus 14:15)*.

**Step 2 - Obedience Required First:** God instructed Moses to "raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea" *(Exodus 14:16)*. Moses had to take the action of faith—lifting his staff toward impossible waters—before seeing any results.

**Step 3 - Miracle Follows Obedience:** Only after Moses stretched out his hand did God drive back the sea with strong east winds all night *(Exodus 14:21)*. The path appeared as they stepped forward in faith, not before.

**Step 4 - Complete Deliverance Revealed:** As the Israelites walked through on dry ground, the full scope of God's plan became clear—not just escape, but the complete destruction of Egypt's army and a powerful demonstration of God's supremacy *(Exodus 14:28-31)*.

**Moses' experience: impossible situation → command to move forward → obedient action required → miracle revealed → full deliverance accomplished.**

## Modern Example: Starting a Ministry

Someone feels called to serve others but doesn't see the full plan. They begin with simple acts of service—visiting elderly neighbors, helping at church, or mentoring youth. As they faithfully take these initial steps, God opens new doors: opportunities to lead, resources appearing, connections forming. The full ministry vision emerges through walking in obedience, not through detailed advance planning.

## How The Pattern Works

God uses step-by-step revelation to build faithful dependence rather than self-sufficiency *(2 Corinthians 5:7 - "we walk by faith, not by sight")*. When we trust Him with partial information and act in obedience, He reveals the next phase. This pattern appears throughout Scripture: Noah building the ark before seeing rain, Peter letting down nets after a fruitless night, the priests stepping into the Jordan before it stopped flowing.

Progressive revelation serves God's purposes: it promotes ongoing relationship rather than independence, builds trust through experience, and keeps us dependent on His guidance rather than our own understanding *(Proverbs 3:5-6)*.

## How To Walk This Pattern Well

- **Take the first step in faith** - Obey what God has already shown you
- **Don't demand the full picture** - Trust God's timing for revealing next steps  
- **Stay in communication** - Keep praying and listening for guidance
- **Look for confirmations** - Watch for how God opens and closes doors
- **Remember past faithfulness** - Recall how God has led you before

The key is faithful obedience to current light, trusting that more light will come as needed. God guides those who walk forward, not those who stand still waiting for complete clarity.

This pattern requires courage to move without seeing the full path, but it develops deeper faith and closer relationship with God than advance knowledge ever could.
