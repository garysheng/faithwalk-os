# The Shapeshifter's Art


***A poem about how Satan splinters logoi from their Source, then crowns the shards as whole.***

The Shapeshifter prowls through history's maze,
Never creating from scratch—only fakes and frays.
He takes what God made good and true,
Twists sacred light to serve his darker view.

Socialism's care for brothers' good,
Satan conjures an unholy priesthood.
Where millions die for Party's call,
And "Equality!" creates bondage for all

Nationalism's love of soil and kin,
Satan twists into racial sin—
Heritage becomes hatred's flame,
Fueling genocide in nation's name.

Democracy's voice of people's will,
Satan turns to empire's kill—
"Freedom" justifies the bombs that fall
Across the lands we "liberate" to hell.

Science engineers the crisis deep,
Then sells the state as salvation's keep.
Medicine sells eternal health,
But steals our soul's eternal wealth.

Spirituality's sacred thirst,
Satan poisons, makes it cursed—
New Age crystals, chakra wheels,
Eastern paths with Western deals.

"Find your truth," the gurus say,
"You are god," they lead astray.
Self-worship dressed as ancient rite,
Darkness masquerading light.

Love that shields the vulnerable,
Satan makes manipulable—
"Love is love" the slogan cries,
While sacred bonds dissolve and die.

Marriage, family, childhood's shield—
To "progress" made to yield.
Sacred boundaries called "hate,"
While chaos storms the garden gate.

Freedom's wholesome dream takes flight—
Free the builder, spark the light;
Lift bureaucracy's heavy yoke,
Let sleeping genius wake and work.

But tech-lords wear the freedom mask,
Make surveillance freedom's task;
Liberty becomes the brand
For oligarchy's iron hand.

For two millennia the game's the same:
Take the Logos, change the name.
Partial truth wrapped round a lie—
Millions follow—millions die.

False ways feel so very right—
They carry fragments of true light.
In every age new empires call,
Each claims truth but leads to fall.

But worship what is not the Way,
And death is all you earn today.
The pattern holds through every age—
False logos writes death's dark page.

Satan never makes from scratch,
Only corrupts what he can catch.
Every idol bears God's face,
Distorted by unholy grace.

Beware what feels so pure and bright,
Yet asks for ultimate devotion's might.
If it claims to save the world's decay
Apart from Christ's own holy way—

Know the Shapeshifter is there,
Weaving lies in sacred prayer.
Every false logos must fail,
Every counterfeit grows pale.

Only Christ, the true Logos,
Heals what sin and Satan break.
For only Truth Himself can free
Us from the Shapeshifter's mockery.
