# Welcome to Our Wonderfully Weird Reality

***A spoken word piece about the supernatural adventure we're already living***

You know what's wild?
We don't need Netflix.
We don't need Hulu or Disney Plus
To get our fix of the supernatural—
We're LIVING in it!

Why do you think Marvel movies hit so hard?
Why do kids naturally gravitate toward magic and mystery?
Because deep down, we KNOW
Our reality is already supernatural.

We just forgot to pay attention.

But look around—
Really LOOK:

People are getting healed in ways that make doctors scratch their heads,
Prophecies are coming true left and right,
Some folks are having conversations with beings
That definitely aren't from around here.

Near-death experiences are giving us glimpses
Of realms that make our wildest sci-fi look boring,
Remote viewers are literally floating their consciousness
Around the world like it's no big deal.

And as a follower of Christ?
Man, I KNOW there are spirits and principalities,
I KNOW possession is real,
I KNOW exorcisms happen,
Because Christ told us this stuff exists—
And He wasn't speaking in metaphors!

We're surrounded by invisible kingdoms,
Angels and demons are having conversations about us,
Prayers are traveling through dimensions,
Miracles are breaking the laws of physics
Every single day.

But we walk around acting like
The most interesting thing happening
Is what's trending on social media!

We're living in a reality where
Consciousness might jump through time,
Where your gut feelings could be
Memories from the future,
Where some people can see things
That haven't happened yet.

We're sharing this planet
With creatures that have consciousness
Beyond our understanding,
In realms we can barely imagine.

This isn't some fantasy novel—
This is TUESDAY!

We're inhabitants of a universe
Where thoughts become things,
Where faith can literally heal bodies,
Where the dead sometimes visit the living,
Where time isn't as linear as we pretend.

The reason we're drawn to superhero movies
Isn't escapism—
It's RECOGNITION.
We're remembering what we forgot:
That we're already living
In the most incredible story ever told.

So why are we bored?
Why are we scrolling for entertainment
When reality itself is more fascinating
Than anything Hollywood could dream up?

We don't need to debate
Whether past lives are real
Or argue about what near-death experiences prove—
We just need to open our eyes
To the wonder that's already here.

Every faithful prayer is a supernatural event,
Every child born is a miracle,
Every moment of genuine love
Is defying the laws of a purely material, entropic universe.

We're not waiting for magic to happen—
We're swimming in it,
Breathing it,
Living it every single day.

The most supernatural thing of all?
That the Creator of this wonderfully weird reality
Knows your name,
Cares about your afternoon,
And invites you to participate
In the cosmic adventure
That's happening right now.

Turn off the TV.
Step outside.
Pay attention.
The show's already started,
And you're not just watching—
You're IN it.
