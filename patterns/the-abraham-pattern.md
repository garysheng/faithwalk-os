# The Abraham Pattern

God often reveals His plans step-by-step rather than all at once. He calls people to take a first step in faith, only showing the next phase as they obey.

## Biblical Example: Abraham

God called Abraham to leave his country without revealing the final destination—He simply said "Go to the land I will show you" *(Genesis 12:1)*. Abraham had to step out in obedience first. As he walked forward in faith, God progressively revealed more details: the promises of descendants, the specific land, and the covenant blessings. Abraham received the full picture only through continued obedience, not upfront knowledge.

## Another Biblical Example: Moses at the Red Sea

When the Israelites faced the Red Sea with Pharaoh's army approaching, God didn't split the waters in advance. He told Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea *(Exodus 14:16)*, requiring the first step of obedience before the miracle. The deliverance became evident only as they moved forward in faith—the waters parted as they approached, not before.

## Modern Example: Starting a Ministry

Someone feels called to serve others but doesn't see the full plan. They begin with simple acts of service—visiting elderly neighbors, helping at church, or mentoring youth. As they faithfully take these initial steps, God opens new doors: opportunities to lead, resources appearing, connections forming. The full ministry vision emerges through walking in obedience, not through detailed advance planning.

## How The Pattern Works

God uses step-by-step revelation to build faithful dependence rather than self-sufficiency *(2 Corinthians 5:7 - "we walk by faith, not by sight")*. When we trust Him with partial information and act in obedience, He reveals the next phase. This pattern appears throughout Scripture: Noah building the ark before seeing rain, Peter letting down nets after a fruitless night, the priests stepping into the Jordan before it stopped flowing.

Progressive revelation serves God's purposes: it promotes ongoing relationship rather than independence, builds trust through experience, and keeps us dependent on His guidance rather than our own understanding *(Proverbs 3:5-6)*.

## How To Walk This Pattern Well

- **Take the first step in faith** - Obey what God has already shown you
- **Don't demand the full picture** - Trust God's timing for revealing next steps  
- **Stay in communication** - Keep praying and listening for guidance
- **Look for confirmations** - Watch for how God opens and closes doors
- **Remember past faithfulness** - Recall how God has led you before

The key is faithful obedience to current light, trusting that more light will come as needed. God guides those who walk forward, not those who stand still waiting for complete clarity.

This pattern requires courage to move without seeing the full path, but it develops deeper faith and closer relationship with God than advance knowledge ever could.
