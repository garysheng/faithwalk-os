# Don't Advance Anti-Christian Causes

*What do you call movements that use truth to push false paths, appeal to your compassion, and lead you away from Christ while feeling righteous?*

False lights. And they're everywhere—from red pill masculinity to climate activism to political ideologies that promise salvation through human systems rather than divine transformation.

The danger isn't that these movements are obviously evil. The danger is that they're reasonable, appealing, and often address real problems. They wouldn't need to be called out as false lights if they didn't feel compelling to people with good hearts.

Your energy is precious. Your compassion can become a weapon the enemy uses to deceive you. It's your kryptonite as someone with a big heart. Make sure you keep your heart for Christ first.

## The Pattern of False Lights

False lights follow Satan's playbook: mix truth with deception, appeal to legitimate grievances, then lead people down paths that ultimately rebel against God's design (2 Corinthians 11:14).

Much of this is powered by "sinfrastructure"—systems that make sin easy and righteousness hard. *[See: Recognize and Resist Sinfrastructure](recognize-and-resist-sinfrastructure.md).* 

Here are a few examples of False Light causes:

- **Red pill masculinity** calls out real problems—feminization of culture, men's lack of purpose, societal attacks on masculinity. But it leads to misogyny, materialism, and treating women as objects rather than image-bearers of God. Andrew Tate speaks truths about establishment corruption while promoting polyamory, consumerism, and pride.

- **Political ideologies** address genuine injustices but offer false salvation. Atheistic libertarianism promises freedom while normalizing gambling, pornography, and drug addiction—freedom without moral grounding becomes license to destroy yourself. Socialism and communism promise justice while making government the savior instead of God.

- **Climate activism** exploits legitimate environmental concerns but generates fear, denies human ingenuity, and promotes scarcity mindset in an abundant universe created by God. The ESG movement becomes a control mechanism disguised as stewardship.

- **Christian Zionism** misrepresents Scripture to justify genocide in Palestine, desecrates Christian heritage sites, and displaces Middle Eastern Christians who carry original understanding of our faith. Tens of millions of Americans are blinded by the spell of this ideology.

- **Surveillance state technology** promises peace and safety through total monitoring. Companies like Palantir, led by fake Christians like Peter Thiel, build pre-crime regimes that treat humans as potential threats to be managed rather than image-bearers of God to be loved. They create dystopia in the name of security ("peace and safety," 1 Thessalonians 5:3).

- **AI worship** promises technological salvation while making machines into gods. People literally treat AI as their savior that will solve humanity's deepest problems. Meanwhile, AI companies destroy the environment, fund sex bot development, and promote the lie that machines can replace divine transformation. Technology will never solve our most important human problems—only God can (Romans 1:25). *[See: Reserve the Pedestal for God](reserve-the-pedestal-for-god.md).* 

- **LGBT+ ideology** makes sexual impulses and sinful nature into identity, with pride literally written into the name. It conflates normalizing sin with human rights and makes a mockery of our embodiment as God's creation. When you make your sexual desires your identity, you're rebelling against God's design for human flourishing. We are called to love one another; but not embrace ideologies that redefine sin as identity.

- **Other faith paths and spiritual practices** can approximate truth yet remain false lights when they deny Christ as Lord and Savior. Syncretism and alternative religions may provide meaning or peace, but they substitute another way for the Way.

Each false light contains enough truth to feel righteous while leading away from Christ's narrow path. Test by fruit (Matthew 7:16).

## Why False Lights Feel So Compelling

False lights succeed because they:

- **Address real problems** that the church has ignored or handled poorly
- **Appeal to your values** of justice, compassion, and truth
- **Offer immediate action** when you feel powerless about complex issues
- **Provide community** with others who share your concerns
- **Give you an enemy to fight** rather than calling you to die to yourself

Your desire to do good becomes the hook. Your compassion becomes the bait. Before you know it, you're advancing causes that ultimately oppose God's kingdom while feeling like a righteous warrior.

Even movements that call themselves Christian can be false lights if they don't create pathways for experiencing God's heart and genuine transformation.

## My Experience With False Lights

I've dedicated enormous energy to causes that felt righteous but were ultimately misplaced.

In crypto, I spent years promoting Bitcoin and Ethereum as salvation from corrupt financial systems, and in some ways a silver bullet for all our problems. The technology addressed real problems, but the community devolved into greed-driven speculation disguised as "building the future." I was advancing a false light that made money into an idol.

In politics, I've been drawn to various movements—on the 'left', 'right', and 'center'—that promised to fix society's problems through better policies or leaders. Each time, I found myself putting more faith in human systems than in God's sovereignty and transformation.

In social causes, I've supported movements that seemed aligned with justice but were ultimately rooted in atheistic worldviews like Wokeism that reject God's design for human flourishing.

The pattern was always the same: identify a real problem, find a movement addressing it, pour energy into advancing their cause—while neglecting the deeper spiritual work God was calling me to.

I am now fully dedicated to advancing God's will rather than these substitutes that promise what only Christ can deliver. I've redirected my energy to building discipleship infrastructure that actually makes following Christ easier.

## Reflection and Practice

**Ask yourself as you evaluate causes and movements:**

1. **Am I advancing God's kingdom or building a compelling human substitute?**
2. **Does this movement require me to compromise biblical truth?**
3. **Am I seeking justice God's way or the world's way?**
4. **Would I still support this if it made fewer disciples of Christ?**

The test isn't whether a cause addresses real problems—it's whether advancing it ultimately serves God's purposes or competes with them.

Don't let your good heart be weaponized against God's kingdom. Keep Christ first, and let Him direct your energy toward causes that truly advance His will. If a cause consistently pulls you into fear, outrage, or idolatry, step back and sever ties with that culture. *[See: Sever Your Ties With Modern Culture](sever-your-ties-with-modern-culture.md).* 

*"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you." — Matthew 6:33*
