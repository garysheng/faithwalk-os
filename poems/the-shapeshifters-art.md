# The Shapeshifter's Art

*A poem about how Satan splinters logoi from their Source, then crowns the shards as whole.*

---

The Shapeshifter prowls through history's halls,
Never creating—only counterfeiting calls.
He takes what God made good and true and right,
Twists kernels of truth into blinding light.

Every evil bears the source code of good—
Socialism's care for brotherhood,
But Satan made it state-worship's shrine,
Where millions died for the Party line.

Nationalism's love of soil and kin,
Satan twisted into racial sin—
Heritage became hatred's flame,
As Jews were murdered in nation's name.

Democracy's voice of people's will,
Satan turned to empire's kill—
"Freedom" justified the bombs that fell
Across the lands we "liberated" to hell.

Science engineered the crisis deep,
Then sold the state as salvation's keep.
Medicine sells eternal health,
But steals our soul's eternal wealth.

Spirituality's sacred thirst,
Satan poisoned, made it cursed—
New Age crystals, chakra wheels,
Eastern paths with Western deals.

"Find your truth," the gurus say,
"You are god," they lead astray.
Self-worship dressed as ancient rite,
Darkness masquerading light.

Love that shields the vulnerable,
Satan made manipulable—
"Love is love" the slogan cries,
While sacred bonds dissolve and die.

Marriage, family, childhood's shield—
To "progress" made to yield.
Sacred boundaries called "hate,"
While chaos storms the garden gate.

Freedom's wholesome dream took flight—
Free the builder, spark the light;
Lift bureaucracy's heavy yoke,
Let sleeping genius wake and work.

But tech-lords wore the freedom mask,
Made surveillance freedom's task;
Liberty became the brand
For oligarchy's iron hand.

For two millennia the game's the same:
Take the Logos, change the name.
Partial truth wrapped round a lie—
Millions follow—millions die.

False ways feel so very right—
They carry fragments of true light.
In every age new empires call,
Each claims truth but leads to fall.

But worship what is not the Way,
And death is all you'll earn today.
The pattern holds through every age—
False logos writes death's dark page.

Satan never makes from scratch,
Only corrupts what he can catch.
Every idol bears God's face,
Distorted by unholy grace.

Beware what feels so pure and bright,
Yet asks for ultimate devotion's might.
If it claims to save the world's decay
Apart from Christ's own holy way—

Know the Shapeshifter is there,
Weaving lies in sacred prayer.
Every false logos must fail,
Every counterfeit grow pale.

Only Christ, the true Logos,
Heals what sin and Satan broke.
Till His victory's complete,
Test each voice: Does it lead to His feet?

For Satan's greatest trick by far
Is making false light shine like a star,
While the true Light humbly stands
With nail-scarred, outstretched hands.

So test each spirit, weigh each call—
Does it bow to Christ as Lord of all?
For only Truth Himself can free
Us from the Shapeshifter's mockery.
