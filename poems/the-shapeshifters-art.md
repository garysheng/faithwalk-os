# The Shapeshifter's Art

*A poem about how Satan splinters logoi from their Source, then crowns the shards as whole.*

---

The Shapeshifter prowls through history's halls,
Never creating—only counterfeiting calls.
He takes what God made good and true and right,
Twists kernels of truth into blinding light.

Every evil bears the source code of good—
Socialism's care for brotherhood,
But Satan made it state-worship's shrine,
Where millions died for the Party line.

Nationalism's love of soil and kin,
Satan twisted into racial sin—
Heritage became hatred's flame,
As Jews were murdered in nation's name.

Democracy's voice of people's will,
Satan turned to empire's kill—
"Freedom" justified the bombs that fell
Across the lands we "liberated" to hell.

Science's quest to understand,
Became control's iron hand.
Medicine's gift to heal and mend,
Twisted to serve profit's end.

Knowledge meant to set us free,
Became thought-policing's key.
Technology to connect and serve,
Now surveillance's ever-watching nerve.

Love that shields the vulnerable,
Satan made manipulable—
"Love is love" the slogan cries,
While sacred bonds dissolve and die.

Marriage, family, childhood's gate—
Redefined as "love" and "hate."
Compassion weaponized to shame
Those who'd guard the sacred frame.

Rainbowed "Pride" became the claim,
The primal sin enthroned as fame;
Sin made sacrament and rite,
Parades of color veil the night.

Freedom's wholesome dream began—
Free the builder, serve the plan;
Lift bureaucracy's heavy yoke,
Let sleeping genius wake and work.

But "libertarians" took the stage,
Built a different kind of cage;
"Let the algorithms decide"—
Pre-crime watches, freedom died.

Enterprise meant to heal and serve
Twisted into power's curve;
"Free markets" rigged for corporate kings,
While wholesome ventures clip their wings.

For two millennia the game's the same:
Take the Logos, change the name.
Partial truth wrapped round a lie—
Millions follow—millions die.

False ways feel so very right—
They carry fragments of true light.
In every age new empires call,
Each claims truth but leads to fall.

But worship what is not the Way,
And death is all you'll earn today.
The pattern holds through every age—
False logos writes death's dark page.

Satan never makes from scratch,
Only corrupts what he can catch.
Every idol bears God's face,
Distorted by unholy grace.

Beware the host that feels so pure,
The cause that seems so right and sure.
If it asks for ultimate devotion,
If it stirs revolutionary motion,

If it promises to save the world
Through human flags unfurled,
If it claims exclusive truth
Apart from Christ's own proof—

Then know the Shapeshifter's there,
Weaving lies in truthful prayer.
For every false logos must fail,
Every counterfeit grow pale.

Only Christ, the true Logos,
Can heal what sin and Satan broke.
Only He contains all truth,
Beauty, goodness without reproof.

All other ways are broken parts,
Fragments of divine arts
Stolen, twisted, weaponized
To keep the soul from paradise.

Worship the false way, reap death's wage.
Follow Christ, turn history's page.
For in Him all logoi find
Their purpose, truth, and peace combined.

The victory is already won—
Evil's reign will soon be done.
Till then, test every voice you hear:
Does it draw to Christ more near?

For Satan's greatest trick by far
Is making false light shine like a star,
While the true Light humbly stands
With nail-scarred, outstretched hands.
