# Study Wise Spiritual Elders

*How did God design the universe? What is God's will for us? How should we live in light of eternal truth? These are not obvious questions with simple answers.*

You have the privilege of building your Christian foundation on elders who spent years if not decades wrestling with these mysteries. They studied Scripture deeply, endured trials that tested their faith, and emerged with tested wisdom about God's creation and His heart for humanity.

Stand on their shoulders. Let their hard-won insights become stepping stones for your journey. Why start from scratch?

## Learning From Living Mentors

If you're blessed with friendships with wise Christians who embody Christ's heart, ask who shaped them. Learn their sources.

My friend Marcus was the first spiritual mentor who fielded the direct questions I couldn’t answer by reading alone. He and his wife Arielle have been profound helps—Marcus on choosing Christ beyond cultural Christianity; Arielle on relationships and discernment. They model prophetic conviction with love. And give me good sources of Truth to dig into.

When you find elders who resonate, go deep. Study how they think, who they study, how they read Scripture, and how they navigate modern tensions.

## Some Elders Whose Wisdom Transcends Labels and Time

Here are a few examples of wise elders that have shaped me:

- Francis Schaeffer. His worldview critique lands even harder today and has strengthened my critique of secular humanism—whether "conscious capitalism," socialism, or communism—false gospels that borrow Christian morality while rejecting Christ.

- C.S. Lewis remains a gold standard for clear, compelling Christian thought that crosses denominational lines. His vision of moral realism and transformed desire still cuts through modern confusion.

- Dr. Michael Cocchini—his journey across religions and rigorous biblical reasoning are refreshing.

- My friend Peter Han—his Tree of Life vs. Tree of Knowledge teaching reshaped how I trust God with money and work.

No single denomination contains all the elders worth learning from. Each has profound wisdom—and serious failings. Don’t let labels limit your learning. Test teaching by Scripture and fruit, not affiliation. When you find elders who resonate, go deep.

## The Practice of Discerning Who To Learn From

**Ask yourself as you encounter spiritual teachers:**

1. **Do they embody Christ's heart or just supposed theological correctness?**
2. **Does their wisdom produce love, truth, and peace in those who follow it?**
3. **Are they willing to critique their own arguments and tradition?**

**Daily Practice:** Test every insight—book, sermon, conversation—by Scripture and fruit. Do not dismiss by source or accept uncritically.

The goal isn’t eclecticism; it’s learning from the fullness of Christ’s body with discernment.

You don’t have to figure this out alone. God has provided teachers. Find them, study them, and let their wisdom sharpen your walk with Jesus.

*"Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another." — Proverbs 27:17*
