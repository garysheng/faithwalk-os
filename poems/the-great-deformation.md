# The Great Deformation

***A poem about how Satan has hijacked our systems for forming God's children***

Each child born carries Heaven's seed,
Designed for holiness and light,
But Satan captured what we need—
The systems meant to form us right.

He seized what's good but changed the core—
Schools should help kids hear God's call,
Instead they train them to adore
Soul-crushing work that keeps them small.

Work was meant to serve our gifts,
Advance the Kingdom we hold dear,
But greed's cold logic swiftly shifts
To dog-eat-dog and rule by fear.

The market's timing now we trust
Instead of God's eternal pace,
We worship GDP's cruel lust
While families lose their sacred place.

When genocide can boost the score,
When sickness profits those who heal,
We've lost what wealth was truly for—
The false has made itself more real.

By the time our generation woke,
We knew only fallen ways,
Every system seemed to choke
The light that should guide our days.

Our modern culture works to sever
Holy bonds that make us whole,
Deforming spirits, now and ever,
To capture every single soul.

But cycles break when darkness flees,
When we can see the systems clear—
We'll build new systems that help us seize
The Truth that casts out fear.

Strongholds of holy formation,
Where children learn their sacred part,
Where business serves God's creation,
And where the Logos rules the heart.

The Great Deformation had its day,
But Christ will set our children free—
They'll build His Kingdom, find His way,
And form the world that's meant to be.
